letter 1

_to mrs. saville, england._


st. petersburgh, dec. 11th, 17—.


you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
forebodings. i arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
of my undertaking.

i am already far north of london, and as i walk in the streets of
petersburgh, i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
braces my nerves and fills me with delight. do you understand this
feeling? this breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
which i am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
and vivid. i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
region of beauty and delight. there, margaret, the sun is for ever
visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
perpetual splendour. there—for with your leave, my sister, i will put
some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;
and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
globe. its productions and features may be without example, as the
phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered
solitudes. what may not be expected in a country of eternal light? i
may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may
regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this
voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. i
shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world
never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by
the foot of man. these are my enticements, and they are sufficient to
conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this
laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little
boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
native river. but supposing all these conjectures to be false, you
cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all
mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole
to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are
requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at
all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.

these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my
letter, and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me
to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as
a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual
eye. this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. i
have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have
been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean
through the seas which surround the pole. you may remember that a
history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the
whole of our good uncle thomas’ library. my education was neglected,
yet i was passionately fond of reading. these volumes were my study
day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which
i had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction
had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.

these visions faded when i perused, for the first time, those poets
whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. i also
became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;
i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the
names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated. you are well
acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment.
but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my
thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.

six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking. i
can, even now, remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this
great enterprise. i commenced by inuring my body to hardship. i
accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the north sea;
i voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; i often
worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my
nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those
branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive
the greatest practical advantage. twice i actually hired myself as an
under-mate in a greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. i
must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second
dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest
earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.

and now, dear margaret, do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
my life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but i preferred glory to
every enticement that wealth placed in my path. oh, that some encouraging
voice would answer in the affirmative! my courage and my resolution is
firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. i am
about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which
will demand all my fortitude: i am required not only to raise the spirits
of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.

this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia. they fly
quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in
my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach. the
cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which i have
already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the
deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise
prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. i have no
ambition to lose my life on the post-road between st. petersburgh and
archangel.

i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my
intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the
insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary
among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. i do not intend to
sail until the month of june; and when shall i return? ah, dear sister, how
can i answer this question? if i succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,
will pass before you and i may meet. if i fail, you will see me again soon,
or never.

farewell, my dear, excellent margaret. heaven shower down blessings on you,
and save me, that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your
love and kindness.

your affectionate brother,

r. walton




letter 2

_to mrs. saville, england._

archangel, 28th march, 17—.


how slowly the time passes here, encompassed as i am by frost and snow!
yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. i have hired a
vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom i have
already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly
possessed of dauntless courage.

but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy, and the
absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil, i have no
friend, margaret: when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there
will be none to participate my joy; if i am assailed by disappointment, no
one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. i shall commit my thoughts
to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of
feeling. i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose
eyes would reply to mine. you may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but i
bitterly feel the want of a friend. i have no one near me, gentle yet
courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose
tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. how would such a
friend repair the faults of your poor brother! i am too ardent in execution
and too impatient of difficulties. but it is a still greater evil to me
that i am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild
on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas’ books of voyages.
at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own
country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its
most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the
necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native
country. now i am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many
schoolboys of fifteen. it is true that i have thought more and that my
daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters
call it) _keeping;_ and i greatly need a friend who would have sense
enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to
endeavour to regulate my mind.

well, these are useless complaints; i shall certainly find no friend on the
wide ocean, nor even here in archangel, among merchants and seamen. yet
some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these
rugged bosoms. my lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage
and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase
more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. he is an
englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,
unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of
humanity. i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;
finding that he was unemployed in this city, i easily engaged him to assist
in my enterprise.

the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the
ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. this
circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made
me very desirous to engage him. a youth passed in solitude, my best years
spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the
groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to
the usual brutality exercised on board ship: i have never believed it to be
necessary, and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness
of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, i felt
myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. i heard
of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the
happiness of her life. this, briefly, is his story. some years ago he loved
a young russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable
sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. he saw
his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in
tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,
confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,
and that her father would never consent to the union. my generous friend
reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,
instantly abandoned his pursuit. he had already bought a farm with his
money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he
bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his
prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young
woman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. but the old
man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,
when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned
until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her
inclinations. “what a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. he is
so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a turk, and a kind
of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct
the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which
otherwise he would command.

yet do not suppose, because i complain a little or because i can
conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know, that i am
wavering in my resolutions. those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage
is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. the
winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it
is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps i may sail
sooner than i expected. i shall do nothing rashly: you know me
sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the
safety of others is committed to my care.

i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my
undertaking. it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of
the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which
i am preparing to depart. i am going to unexplored regions, to “the
land of mist and snow,” but i shall kill no albatross; therefore do not
be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and
woeful as the “ancient mariner.” you will smile at my allusion, but i
will disclose a secret. i have often attributed my attachment to, my
passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that
production of the most imaginative of modern poets. there is something
at work in my soul which i do not understand. i am practically
industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and
labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief
in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out
of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited
regions i am about to explore.

but to return to dearer considerations. shall i meet you again, after
having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of
africa or america? i dare not expect such success, yet i cannot bear to
look on the reverse of the picture. continue for the present to write to
me by every opportunity: i may receive your letters on some occasions when
i need them most to support my spirits. i love you very tenderly. 
remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.

your affectionate brother,
 robert walton




letter 3

_to mrs. saville, england._

july 7th, 17—.


my dear sister,

i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safe—and well advanced
on my voyage. this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on
its homeward voyage from archangel; more fortunate than i, who may not
see my native land, perhaps, for many years. i am, however, in good
spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the
floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers
of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. we
have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of
summer, and although not so warm as in england, the southern gales,
which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire
to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not
expected.

no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a
letter. one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are
accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and
i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.

adieu, my dear margaret. be assured that for my own sake, as well as
yours, i will not rashly encounter danger. i will be cool,
persevering, and prudent.

but success _shall_ crown my endeavours. wherefore not? thus far i
have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars
themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. why not
still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? what can stop the
determined heart and resolved will of man?

my swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. but i must
finish. heaven bless my beloved sister!

r.w.




letter 4


_to mrs. saville, england._

august 5th, 17—.

so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear
recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before
these papers can come into your possession.

last monday (july 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which
she floated. our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we
were compassed round by a very thick fog. we accordingly lay to,
hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.

about two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out
in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to
have no end. some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to
grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly
attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own
situation. we perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by
dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a
being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,
sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. we watched the rapid progress
of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the
distant inequalities of the ice.

this appearance excited our unqualified wonder. we were, as we believed,
many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that
it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. shut in, however, by
ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the
greatest attention.

about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before
night the ice broke and freed our ship. we, however, lay to until the
morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which
float about after the breaking up of the ice. i profited of this time to
rest for a few hours.

in the morning, however, as soon as it was light, i went upon deck and
found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently
talking to someone in the sea. it was, in fact, a sledge, like that we
had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large
fragment of ice. only one dog remained alive; but there was a human
being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
he was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
some undiscovered island, but a european. when i appeared on deck the
master said, “here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish
on the open sea.”

on perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in english, although with a
foreign accent. “before i come on board your vessel,” said he,
“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”

you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed
to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have
supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not
have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. i
replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the
northern pole.

upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
good god! margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for
his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. his limbs were
nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and
suffering. i never saw a man in so wretched a condition. we attempted
to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh
air he fainted. we accordingly brought him back to the deck and
restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to
swallow a small quantity. as soon as he showed signs of life we
wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the
kitchen stove. by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,
which restored him wonderfully.

two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and i often
feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. when he
had in some measure recovered, i removed him to my own cabin and
attended on him as much as my duty would permit. i never saw a more
interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of
wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone
performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most
trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with
a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled. but he
is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his
teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.

when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off
the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but i would not
allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body
and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice
in so strange a vehicle.

his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and
he replied, “to seek one who fled from me.”

“and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”

“yes.”

“then i fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we
saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”

this aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of
questions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had
pursued. soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “i have,
doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good
people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”

“certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to
trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”

“and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have
benevolently restored me to life.”

soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the
ice had destroyed the other sledge. i replied that i could not answer
with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near
midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety
before that time; but of this i could not judge.

from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the
stranger. he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for
the sledge which had before appeared; but i have persuaded him to remain in
the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.
i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant
notice if any new object should appear in sight.

such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the
present day. the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very
silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all
interested in him, although they have had very little communication
with him. for my own part, i begin to love him as a brother, and his
constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. he must
have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
so attractive and amiable.

i said in one of my letters, my dear margaret, that i should find no friend
on the wide ocean; yet i have found a man who, before his spirit had been
broken by misery, i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother
of my heart.

i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,
should i have any fresh incidents to record.




august 13th, 17—.


my affection for my guest increases every day. he excites at once my
admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. how can i see so
noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant
grief? he is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and
when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,
yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.

he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,
apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. yet, although
unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he
interests himself deeply in the projects of others. he has frequently
conversed with me on mine, which i have communicated to him without
disguise. he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my
eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken
to secure it. i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the
language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul
and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly i would
sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my
enterprise. one man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for
the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought, for the dominion i should
acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. as i spoke, a
dark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. at first i
perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before
his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle
fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. i
paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “unhappy man! do you
share my madness? have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? hear me;
let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”

such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the
paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened
powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were
necessary to restore his composure.

having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise
himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of
despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. he asked
me the history of my earlier years. the tale was quickly told, but it
awakened various trains of reflection. i spoke of my desire of finding a
friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than
had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could
boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.

“i agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are
unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than
ourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to
perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. i once had a friend, the most
noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting
friendship. you have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for
despair. but i—i have lost everything and cannot begin life
anew.”

as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled
grief that touched me to the heart. but he was silent and presently
retired to his cabin.

even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he
does the beauties of nature. the starry sky, the sea, and every sight
afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of
elevating his soul from earth. such a man has a double existence: he
may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he
has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a
halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.

will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine
wanderer? you would not if you saw him. you have been tutored and
refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore
somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to
appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. sometimes i
have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that
elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew. i
believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing
power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled
for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a
voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.




august 19th, 17—.


yesterday the stranger said to me, “you may easily perceive, captain
walton, that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. i had
determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with
me, but you have won me to alter my determination. you seek for
knowledge and wisdom, as i once did; and i ardently hope that the
gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine
has been. i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be
useful to you; yet, when i reflect that you are pursuing the same
course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me
what i am, i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one
that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you
in case of failure. prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually
deemed marvellous. were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might
fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things
will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would
provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers
of nature; nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series
internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”

you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered
communication, yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by
a recital of his misfortunes. i felt the greatest eagerness to hear
the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong
desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. i expressed
these feelings in my answer.

“i thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is
useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. i wait but for one event, and then i
shall repose in peace. i understand your feeling,” continued he,
perceiving that i wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my
friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my
destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is
determined.”

he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i
should be at leisure. this promise drew from me the warmest thanks. i have
resolved every night, when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to
record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during
the day. if i should be engaged, i will at least make notes. this
manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who
know him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and
sympathy shall i read it in some future day! even now, as i commence my
task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me
with all their melancholy sweetness; i see his thin hand raised in
animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul
within. strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which
embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!




chapter 1


i am by birth a genevese, and my family is one of the most
distinguished of that republic. my ancestors had been for many years
counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public
situations with honour and reputation. he was respected by all who
knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public
business. he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the
affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a
husband and the father of a family.

as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, i cannot
refrain from relating them. one of his most intimate friends was a
merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
mischances, into poverty. this man, whose name was beaufort, was of a
proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty
and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
distinguished for his rank and magnificence. having paid his debts,
therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
daughter to the town of lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
wretchedness. my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and
was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct
so little worthy of the affection that united them. he lost no time in
endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin
the world again through his credit and assistance.

beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten
months before my father discovered his abode. overjoyed at this discovery,
he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the
reuss. but when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. beaufort
had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but
it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in
the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
merchant’s house. the interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;
his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for
reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end
of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.

his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw
with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that
there was no other prospect of support. but caroline beaufort
possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support
her in her adversity. she procured plain work; she plaited straw and
by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to
support life.

several months passed in this manner. her father grew worse; her time
was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence
decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving
her an orphan and a beggar. this last blow overcame her, and she knelt
by beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the
chamber. he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who
committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he
conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a
relation. two years after this event caroline became his wife.

there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but
this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted
affection. there was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind
which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love
strongly. perhaps during former years he had suffered from the
late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set
a greater value on tried worth. there was a show of gratitude and
worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the
doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her
virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing
her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace
to his behaviour to her. everything was made to yield to her wishes
and her convenience. he strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is
sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her
with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
benevolent mind. her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto
constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. during
the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had
gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after
their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy, and the change
of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,
as a restorative for her weakened frame.

from italy they visited germany and france. i, their eldest child, was born
at naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. i remained
for several years their only child. much as they were attached to each
other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very
mine of love to bestow them upon me. my mother’s tender caresses and
my father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my
first recollections. i was their plaything and their idol, and something
better—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on
them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in
their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled
their duties towards me. with this deep consciousness of what they owed
towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit
of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during
every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience, of charity,
and of self-control, i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but
one train of enjoyment to me.

for a long time i was their only care. my mother had much desired to have a
daughter, but i continued their single offspring. when i was about five
years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy, they
passed a week on the shores of the lake of como. their benevolent
disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. this, to my
mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a
passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been
relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the
afflicted. during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale
attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number
of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst
shape. one day, when my father had gone by himself to milan, my mother,
accompanied by me, visited this abode. she found a peasant and his wife,
hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to
five hungry babes. among these there was one which attracted my mother far
above all the rest. she appeared of a different stock. the four others were
dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. her
hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her
clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. her brow was
clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of
her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold
her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,
and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.

the peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and
admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. she was
not her child, but the daughter of a milanese nobleman. her mother was a
german and had died on giving her birth. the infant had been placed with
these good people to nurse: they were better off then. they had not been
long married, and their eldest child was but just born. the father of their
charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory
of italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted
himself to obtain the liberty of his country. he became the victim of its
weakness. whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria
was not known. his property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and
a beggar. she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude
abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.

when my father returned from milan, he found playing with me in the hall of
our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed
to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter
than the chamois of the hills. the apparition was soon explained. with his
permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their
charge to her. they were fond of the sweet orphan. her presence had seemed
a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty
and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection. they
consulted their village priest, and the result was that elizabeth lavenza
became the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than
sister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and
my pleasures.

everyone loved elizabeth. the passionate and almost reverential
attachment with which all regarded her became, while i shared it, my
pride and my delight. on the evening previous to her being brought to
my home, my mother had said playfully, “i have a pretty present for my
victor—tomorrow he shall have it.” and when, on the morrow, she
presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift, i, with childish
seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth
as mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. all praises bestowed on
her i received as made to a possession of my own. we called each other
familiarly by the name of cousin. no word, no expression could body
forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than
sister, since till death she was to be mine only.




chapter 2


we were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in
our ages. i need not say that we were strangers to any species of
disunion or dispute. harmony was the soul of our companionship, and
the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us
nearer together. elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated
disposition; but, with all my ardour, i was capable of a more intense
application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.
she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;
and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss
home —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,
tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of
our alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the
magnificent appearances of things, i delighted in investigating their
causes. the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine.
curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,
gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the
earliest sensations i can remember.

on the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave
up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native
country. we possessed a house in geneva, and a _campagne_ on belrive,
the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a
league from the city. we resided principally in the latter, and the
lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. it was my
temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. i was
indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but i united
myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. henry
clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva. he was a boy of singular
talent and fancy. he loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for
its own sake. he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. he
composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and
knightly adventure. he tried to make us act plays and to enter into
masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of
roncesvalles, of the round table of king arthur, and the chivalrous
train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands
of the infidels.

no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. my
parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.
we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to
their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights
which we enjoyed. when i mingled with other families i distinctly
discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted
the development of filial love.

my temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some
law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits
but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things
indiscriminately. i confess that neither the structure of languages,
nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states
possessed attractions for me. it was the secrets of heaven and earth
that i desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of
things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man
that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,
or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.

meanwhile clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral
relations of things. the busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,
and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was
to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the
gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. the saintly soul
of elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of
her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. she was
the living spirit of love to soften and attract; i might have become
sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that
she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. and
clerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval? yet
he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his
generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for
adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of
beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring
ambition.

i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,
before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of
extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. besides,
in drawing the picture of my early days, i also record those events which
led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when i would
account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my
destiny i find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost
forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent
which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.

natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; i desire,
therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my
predilection for that science. when i was thirteen years of age we all went
on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon; the inclemency of the
weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. in this house i
chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa. i opened it
with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful
facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. a new
light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, i communicated my
discovery to my father. my father looked carelessly at the title page of my
book and said, “ah! cornelius agrippa! my dear victor, do not waste
your time upon this; it is sad trash.”

if, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me
that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern
system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers
than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while
those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances i
should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my
imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my
former studies. it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never
have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. but the cursory glance
my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was
acquainted with its contents, and i continued to read with the greatest
avidity.

when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this
author, and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus. i read and
studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me
treasures known to few besides myself. i have described myself as always
having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of
nature. in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern
philosophers, i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.
sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking
up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. those of his
successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquainted
appeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same
pursuit.

the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted
with their practical uses. the most learned philosopher knew little
more. he had partially unveiled the face of nature, but her immortal
lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. he might dissect,
anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes
in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. i
had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep
human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and
ignorantly i had repined.

but here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew
more. i took their word for all that they averred, and i became their
disciple. it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth
century; but while i followed the routine of education in the schools of
geneva, i was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite
studies. my father was not scientific, and i was left to struggle with a
child’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.
under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest
diligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir
of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. wealth was an
inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if i could
banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but
a violent death!

nor were these my only visions. the raising of ghosts or devils was a
promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which
i most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, i
attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a
want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. and thus for a time i was
occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand
contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of
multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish
reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.

when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near
belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. it
advanced from behind the mountains of jura, and the thunder burst at once
with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. i remained,
while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.
as i stood at the door, on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue from an
old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so
soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing
remained but a blasted stump. when we visited it the next morning, we found
the tree shattered in a singular manner. it was not splintered by the
shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. i never beheld
anything so utterly destroyed.

before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of
electricity. on this occasion a man of great research in natural
philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on
the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of
electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.
all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa,
albertus magnus, and paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by
some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my
accustomed studies. it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever
be known. all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
despicable. by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps
most subject to in early youth, i at once gave up my former
occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed
and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a
would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of
real knowledge. in this mood of mind i betook myself to the
mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as
being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.

thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments
are we bound to prosperity or ruin. when i look back, it seems to me
as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the
immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort
made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even
then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. her victory was
announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which
followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting
studies. it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with
their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.

it was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.
destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and
terrible destruction.




chapter 3


when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i
should become a student at the university of ingolstadt. i had
hitherto attended the schools of geneva, but my father thought it
necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made
acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. my
departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day
resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life
occurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.

elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was
in the greatest danger. during her illness many arguments had been urged to
persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. she had at first
yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her
favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. she
attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity
of the distemper—elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this
imprudence were fatal to her preserver. on the third day my mother
sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the
looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. on her
deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert
her. she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself. “my
children,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were
placed on the prospect of your union. this expectation will now be the
consolation of your father. elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to
my younger children. alas! i regret that i am taken from you; and, happy
and beloved as i have been, is it not hard to quit you all? but these are
not thoughts befitting me; i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to
death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”

she died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent
by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the
soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. it is so
long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day
and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed
for ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been
extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear
can be hushed, never more to be heard. these are the reflections of
the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the
evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. yet from whom has
not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? and why should i
describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? the time at
length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and
the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a
sacrilege, is not banished. my mother was dead, but we had still
duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the
rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the
spoiler has not seized.

my departure for ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,
was now again determined upon. i obtained from my father a respite of
some weeks. it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,
akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of
life. i was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. i was
unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above
all, i desired to see my sweet elizabeth in some degree consoled.

she indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.
she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and
zeal. she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call
her uncle and cousins. never was she so enchanting as at this time,
when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.
she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.

the day of my departure at length arrived. clerval spent the last
evening with us. he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit
him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. his
father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the
aspirations and ambition of his son. henry deeply felt the misfortune
of being debarred from a liberal education. he said little, but when
he spoke i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a
restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details
of commerce.

we sat late. we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor
persuade ourselves to say the word “farewell!” it was said, and we
retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the
other was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn i descended to the
carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father
again to bless me, clerval to press my hand once more, my elizabeth to
renew her entreaties that i would write often and to bestow the last
feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.

i threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in
the most melancholy reflections. i, who had ever been surrounded by
amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual
pleasure—i was now alone. in the university whither i was going i
must form my own friends and be my own protector. my life had hitherto
been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible
repugnance to new countenances. i loved my brothers, elizabeth, and
clerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but i believed myself
totally unfitted for the company of strangers. such were my reflections as
i commenced my journey; but as i proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. i
ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. i had often, when at home,
thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had
longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings. 
now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to
repent.

i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my
journey to ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. at length the
high white steeple of the town met my eyes. i alighted and was
conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as i pleased.

the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to
some of the principal professors. chance—or rather the evil
influence, the angel of destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me
from the moment i turned my reluctant steps from my father’s
door—led me first to m. krempe, professor of natural philosophy. he
was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. he
asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches
of science appertaining to natural philosophy. i replied carelessly, and
partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal
authors i had studied. the professor stared. “have you,” he
said, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”

i replied in the affirmative. “every minute,” continued m. krempe with
warmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly
and entirely lost. you have burdened your memory with exploded systems
and useless names. good god! in what desert land have you lived,
where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you
have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they
are ancient? i little expected, in this enlightened and scientific
age, to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus. my dear
sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”

so saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books
treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and
dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following
week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural
philosophy in its general relations, and that m. waldman, a fellow
professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he
omitted.

i returned home not disappointed, for i have said that i had long
considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but i
returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any
shape. m. krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a
repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
favour of his pursuits. in rather a too philosophical and connected a
strain, perhaps, i have given an account of the conclusions i had come
to concerning them in my early years. as a child i had not been
content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural
science. with a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my
extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, i had retrod the
steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the
discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.
besides, i had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
it was very different when the masters of the science sought
immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now
the scene was changed. the ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in
science was chiefly founded. i was required to exchange chimeras of
boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.

such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my
residence at ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming
acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new
abode. but as the ensuing week commenced, i thought of the information
which m. krempe had given me concerning the lectures. and although i
could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver
sentences out of a pulpit, i recollected what he had said of m.
waldman, whom i had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.

partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, i went into the lecturing
room, which m. waldman entered shortly after. this professor was very
unlike his colleague. he appeared about fifty years of age, but with an
aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his
temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. his person
was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever heard.
he began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and
the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing
with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. he then took
a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of
its elementary terms. after having made a few preparatory experiments, he
concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which i
shall never forget:

“the ancient teachers of this science,” said he,
“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. the modern masters
promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that
the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem
only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or
crucible, have indeed performed miracles. they penetrate into the recesses
of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. they ascend into the
heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of
the air we breathe. they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;
they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even
mock the invisible world with its own shadows.”

such were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of
the fate—enounced to destroy me. as he went on i felt as if my soul
were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were
touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was
sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,
one purpose. so much has been done, exclaimed the soul of
frankenstein—more, far more, will i achieve; treading in the steps
already marked, i will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and
unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.

i closed not my eyes that night. my internal being was in a state of
insurrection and turmoil; i felt that order would thence arise, but i
had no power to produce it. by degrees, after the morning’s dawn,
sleep came. i awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.
there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to
devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a
natural talent. on the same day i paid m. waldman a visit. his
manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,
for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in
his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. i
gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had
given to his fellow professor. he heard with attention the little
narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius
agrippa and paracelsus, but without the contempt that m. krempe had
exhibited. he said that “these were men to whose indefatigable zeal
modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their
knowledge. they had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names
and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a
great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. the
labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever
fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.” i
listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption
or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my
prejudices against modern chemists; i expressed myself in measured
terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his
instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have
made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended
labours. i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to
procure.

“i am happy,” said m. waldman, “to have gained a
disciple; and if your application equals your ability, i have no doubt of
your success. chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the
greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that
i have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, i have not
neglected the other branches of science. a man would make but a very sorry
chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. if your
wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty
experimentalist, i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural
philosophy, including mathematics.”

he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his
various machines, instructing me as to what i ought to procure and
promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough in
the science not to derange their mechanism. he also gave me the list of
books which i had requested, and i took my leave.

thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.




chapter 4


from this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the
most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.
i read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,
which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. i attended the
lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the
university, and i found even in m. krempe a great deal of sound sense
and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive
physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. in
m. waldman i found a true friend. his gentleness was never tinged by
dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and
good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. in a thousand ways
he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse
inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. my application was at
first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as i proceeded and
soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the
light of morning whilst i was yet engaged in my laboratory.

as i applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress
was rapid. my ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and
my proficiency that of the masters. professor krempe often asked me,
with a sly smile, how cornelius agrippa went on, whilst m. waldman
expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. two years
passed in this manner, during which i paid no visit to geneva, but was
engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which i
hoped to make. none but those who have experienced them can conceive
of the enticements of science. in other studies you go as far as
others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must
infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and i, who
continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was
solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two
years i made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical
instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the
university. when i had arrived at this point and had become as well
acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt, my
residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, i thought
of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident
happened that protracted my stay.

one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was
the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with
life. whence, i often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
it was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a
mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our
inquiries. i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined
thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of
natural philosophy which relate to physiology. unless i had been
animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this
study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. to examine the
causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. i became
acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; i
must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my
mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. i do not ever
remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared
the apparition of a spirit. darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and
a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of
life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become
food for the worm. now i was led to examine the cause and progress of
this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and
charnel-houses. my attention was fixed upon every object the most
insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. i saw how the
fine form of man was degraded and wasted; i beheld the corruption of
death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; i saw how the worm
inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. i paused, examining and
analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change
from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this
darkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and
wondrous, yet so simple, that while i became dizzy with the immensity
of the prospect which it illustrated, i was surprised that among so
many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same
science, that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a
secret.

remember, i am not recording the vision of a madman. the sun does not
more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is
true. some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the
discovery were distinct and probable. after days and nights of
incredible labour and fatigue, i succeeded in discovering the cause of
generation and life; nay, more, i became myself capable of bestowing
animation upon lifeless matter.

the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery
soon gave place to delight and rapture. after so much time spent in
painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the
most gratifying consummation of my toils. but this discovery was so
great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been
progressively led to it were obliterated, and i beheld only the result.
what had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation
of the world was now within my grasp. not that, like a magic scene, it
all opened upon me at once: the information i had obtained was of a
nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as i should point them
towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already
accomplished. i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead
and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly
ineffectual light.

i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes
express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with
which i am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end
of my story, and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that
subject. i will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as i then was,
to your destruction and infallible misery. learn from me, if not by my
precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of
knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town
to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature
will allow.

when i found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, i hesitated
a long time concerning the manner in which i should employ it.
although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to
prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of
fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
difficulty and labour. i doubted at first whether i should attempt the
creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my
imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to
doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful
as man. the materials at present within my command hardly appeared
adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but i doubted not that i should
ultimately succeed. i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my
operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be
imperfect, yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes
place in science and mechanics, i was encouraged to hope my present
attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. nor
could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any
argument of its impracticability. it was with these feelings that i
began the creation of a human being. as the minuteness of the parts
formed a great hindrance to my speed, i resolved, contrary to my first
intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,
about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. after having
formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully
collecting and arranging my materials, i began.

no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like
a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. life and death
appeared to me ideal bounds, which i should first break through, and
pour a torrent of light into our dark world. a new species would bless
me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would
owe their being to me. no father could claim the gratitude of his
child so completely as i should deserve theirs. pursuing these
reflections, i thought that if i could bestow animation upon lifeless
matter, i might in process of time (although i now found it impossible)
renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.

these thoughts supported my spirits, while i pursued my undertaking
with unremitting ardour. my cheek had grown pale with study, and my
person had become emaciated with confinement. sometimes, on the very
brink of certainty, i failed; yet still i clung to the hope which the
next day or the next hour might realise. one secret which i alone
possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself; and the moon
gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
eagerness, i pursued nature to her hiding-places. who shall conceive
the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps
of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless
clay? my limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but
then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; i seemed
to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. it was
indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed
acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, i had
returned to my old habits. i collected bones from charnel-houses and
disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human
frame. in a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,
and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,
i kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. the
dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;
and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,
whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, i
brought my work near to a conclusion.

the summer months passed while i was thus engaged, heart and soul, in
one pursuit. it was a most beautiful season; never did the fields
bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant
vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. and the
same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also
to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom i had
not seen for so long a time. i knew my silence disquieted them, and i
well remembered the words of my father: “i know that while you are
pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall
hear regularly from you. you must pardon me if i regard any
interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties
are equally neglected.”

i knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but i could
not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which
had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. i wished, as it
were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection
until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,
should be completed.

i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect
to vice or faultiness on my part, but i am now convinced that he was
justified in conceiving that i should not be altogether free from
blame. a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
disturb his tranquillity. i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge
is an exception to this rule. if the study to which you apply yourself
has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for
those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that
study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human
mind. if this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit
whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic
affections, greece had not been enslaved, cæsar would have spared his
country, america would have been discovered more gradually, and the
empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed.

but i forget that i am moralizing in the most interesting part of my
tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.

my father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my
silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but i did not
watch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always
yielded me supreme delight—so deeply was i engrossed in my
occupation. the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near
to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had
succeeded. but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and i appeared
rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other
unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.
every night i was oppressed by a slow fever, and i became nervous to a most
painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and i shunned my fellow
creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime. sometimes i grew alarmed at
the wreck i perceived that i had become; the energy of my purpose alone
sustained me: my labours would soon end, and i believed that exercise and
amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and i promised myself
both of these when my creation should be complete.




chapter 5


it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment
of my toils. with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, i
collected the instruments of life around me, that i might infuse a
spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. it was
already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the
panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the
half-extinguished light, i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature
open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.

how can i describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate
the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to
form? his limbs were in proportion, and i had selected his features as
beautiful. beautiful! great god! his yellow skin scarcely covered
the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous
black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these
luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,
that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which
they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.

the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings
of human nature. i had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole
purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. for this i had
deprived myself of rest and health. i had desired it with an ardour
that far exceeded moderation; but now that i had finished, the beauty
of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my
heart. unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created, i
rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my
bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. at length lassitude
succeeded to the tumult i had before endured, and i threw myself on the
bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
but it was in vain; i slept, indeed, but i was disturbed by the wildest
dreams. i thought i saw elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in
the streets of ingolstadt. delighted and surprised, i embraced her,
but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with
the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and i thought that i
held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her
form, and i saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.
i started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my
teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and
yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window
shutters, i beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom i had
created. he held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they
may be called, were fixed on me. his jaws opened, and he muttered some
inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. he might have
spoken, but i did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to
detain me, but i escaped and rushed downstairs. i took refuge in the
courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited, where i remained
during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest
agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if
it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i
had so miserably given life.

oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. a mummy
again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. i
had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those
muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing
such as even dante could not have conceived.

i passed the night wretchedly. sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and
hardly that i felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, i nearly
sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. mingled with
this horror, i felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had
been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a
hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!

morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my
sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt, its white steeple
and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. the porter opened the gates
of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and i issued into
the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if i sought to avoid the
wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my
view. i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited, but
felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured
from a black and comfortless sky.

i continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by
bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. i
traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or
what i was doing. my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and i
hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:
 
 like one who, on a lonely road,
 doth walk in fear and dread,
 and, having once turned round, walks on,
 and turns no more his head;
 because he knows a frightful fiend
 doth close behind him tread.
 
 [coleridge’s “ancient mariner.”]



continuing thus, i came at length opposite to the inn at which the various
diligences and carriages usually stopped. here i paused, i knew not why;
but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming
towards me from the other end of the street. as it drew nearer i observed
that it was the swiss diligence; it stopped just where i was standing, and
on the door being opened, i perceived henry clerval, who, on seeing me,
instantly sprung out. “my dear frankenstein,” exclaimed he,
“how glad i am to see you! how fortunate that you should be here at
the very moment of my alighting!”

nothing could equal my delight on seeing clerval; his presence brought back
to my thoughts my father, elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear
to my recollection. i grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror
and misfortune; i felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,
calm and serene joy. i welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial
manner, and we walked towards my college. clerval continued talking for
some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being
permitted to come to ingolstadt. “you may easily believe,” said
he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all
necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;
and, indeed, i believe i left him incredulous to the last, for his constant
answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch
schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield: ‘i have ten thousand florins
a year without greek, i eat heartily without greek.’ but his
affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has
permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of
knowledge.”

“it gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left
my father, brothers, and elizabeth.”

“very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from
you so seldom. by the by, i mean to lecture you a little upon their
account myself. but, my dear frankenstein,” continued he, stopping
short and gazing full in my face, “i did not before remark how very ill
you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for
several nights.”

“you have guessed right; i have lately been so deeply engaged in one
occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;
but i hope, i sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an
end and that i am at length free.”

i trembled excessively; i could not endure to think of, and far less to
allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. i walked with a
quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. i then reflected, and
the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom i had left in my
apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. i dreaded to
behold this monster, but i feared still more that henry should see him.
entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the
stairs, i darted up towards my own room. my hand was already on the
lock of the door before i recollected myself. i then paused, and a
cold shivering came over me. i threw the door forcibly open, as
children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. i stepped
fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed
from its hideous guest. i could hardly believe that so great a good
fortune could have befallen me, but when i became assured that my enemy
had indeed fled, i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval.

we ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;
but i was unable to contain myself. it was not joy only that possessed
me; i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse
beat rapidly. i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same
place; i jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.
clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,
but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes
for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless
laughter frightened and astonished him.

“my dear victor,” cried he, “what, for god’s sake,
is the matter? do not laugh in that manner. how ill you are! what is the
cause of all this?”

“do not ask me,” cried i, putting my hands before my eyes, for i
thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can
tell. oh, save me! save me!” i imagined that the monster seized me;
i struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.

poor clerval! what must have been his feelings? a meeting, which he
anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. but i
was not the witness of his grief, for i was lifeless and did not
recover my senses for a long, long time.

this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for
several months. during all that time henry was my only nurse. i
afterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness
for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make
elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my
disorder. he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive
nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he
did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest
action that he could towards them.

but i was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and
unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.
the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was for ever
before my eyes, and i raved incessantly concerning him. doubtless my
words surprised henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings
of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which i
continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder
indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.

by very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and
grieved my friend, i recovered. i remember the first time i became
capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, i
perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young
buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. it was
a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my
convalescence. i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in
my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time i became as
cheerful as before i was attacked by the fatal passion.

“dearest clerval,” exclaimed i, “how kind, how very good
you are to me. this whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you
promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. how shall i ever
repay you? i feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which i
have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”

“you will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get
well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, i
may speak to you on one subject, may i not?”

i trembled. one subject! what could it be? could he allude to an object on
whom i dared not even think?

“compose yourself,” said clerval, who observed my change of
colour, “i will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father
and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your
own handwriting. they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at
your long silence.”

“is that all, my dear henry? how could you suppose that my first
thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom i love and
who are so deserving of my love?”

“if this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad
to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from
your cousin, i believe.”




chapter 6


clerval then put the following letter into my hands. it was from my
own elizabeth:

“my dearest cousin,

“you have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear
kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. you are
forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear victor,
is necessary to calm our apprehensions. for a long time i have thought
that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have
restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt. i have
prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so
long a journey, yet how often have i regretted not being able to
perform it myself! i figure to myself that the task of attending on
your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never
guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of
your poor cousin. yet that is over now: clerval writes that indeed
you are getting better. i eagerly hope that you will confirm this
intelligence soon in your own handwriting.

“get well—and return to us. you will find a happy, cheerful home and
friends who love you dearly. your father’s health is vigorous, and he
asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a
care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. how pleased you would
be to remark the improvement of our ernest! he is now sixteen and full
of activity and spirit. he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter
into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his
elder brother returns to us. my uncle is not pleased with the idea of
a military career in a distant country, but ernest never had your
powers of application. he looks upon study as an odious fetter; his
time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the
lake. i fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point
and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.

“little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken
place since you left us. the blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they
never change; and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are
regulated by the same immutable laws. my trifling occupations take up
my time and amuse me, and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing
none but happy, kind faces around me. since you left us, but one
change has taken place in our little household. do you remember on
what occasion justine moritz entered our family? probably you do not;
i will relate her history, therefore in a few words. madame moritz,
her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom justine was the
third. this girl had always been the favourite of her father, but
through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and
after the death of m. moritz, treated her very ill. my aunt observed
this, and when justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother
to allow her to live at our house. the republican institutions of our
country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which
prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. hence there is less
distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the
lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are
more refined and moral. a servant in geneva does not mean the same
thing as a servant in france and england. justine, thus received in
our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our
fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a
sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.

“justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and i
recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one
glance from justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that
ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelica—she looked so
frank-hearted and happy. my aunt conceived a great attachment for her,
by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that
which she had at first intended. this benefit was fully repaid;
justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: i do not
mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips, but
you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,
yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. she
thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her
phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.

“when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own
grief to notice poor justine, who had attended her during her illness
with the most anxious affection. poor justine was very ill; but other
trials were reserved for her.

“one by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the
exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. the
conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the
deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her
partiality. she was a roman catholic; and i believe her confessor
confirmed the idea which she had conceived. accordingly, a few months
after your departure for ingolstadt, justine was called home by her
repentant mother. poor girl! she wept when she quitted our house; she
was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness
and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable
for vivacity. nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature
to restore her gaiety. the poor woman was very vacillating in her
repentance. she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness,
but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her
brothers and sister. perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz
into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is
now at peace for ever. she died on the first approach of cold weather,
at the beginning of this last winter. justine has just returned to us;
and i assure you i love her tenderly. she is very clever and gentle,
and extremely pretty; as i mentioned before, her mien and her
expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.

“i must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling
william. i wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with
sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. when he
smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with
health. he has already had one or two little _wives,_ but louisa biron
is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.

“now, dear victor, i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little
gossip concerning the good people of geneva. the pretty miss mansfield
has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching
marriage with a young englishman, john melbourne, esq. her ugly
sister, manon, married m. duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. your
favourite schoolfellow, louis manoir, has suffered several misfortunes
since the departure of clerval from geneva. but he has already
recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a
lively pretty frenchwoman, madame tavernier. she is a widow, and much
older than manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with
everybody.

“i have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety
returns upon me as i conclude. write, dearest victor,—one line—one
word will be a blessing to us. ten thousand thanks to henry for his
kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely
grateful. adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, i entreat
you, write!

“elizabeth lavenza.


“geneva, march 18th, 17—.”



“dear, dear elizabeth!” i exclaimed, when i had read her
letter: “i will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety
they must feel.” i wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but
my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. in another
fortnight i was able to leave my chamber.

one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the
several professors of the university. in doing this, i underwent a
kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had
sustained. ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the
beginning of my misfortunes, i had conceived a violent antipathy even
to the name of natural philosophy. when i was otherwise quite restored
to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony
of my nervous symptoms. henry saw this, and had removed all my
apparatus from my view. he had also changed my apartment; for he
perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had
previously been my laboratory. but these cares of clerval were made of
no avail when i visited the professors. m. waldman inflicted torture
when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress i
had made in the sciences. he soon perceived that i disliked the
subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to
modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science
itself, with a desire, as i evidently saw, of drawing me out. what
could i do? he meant to please, and he tormented me. i felt as if he
had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which
were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. i
writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt.
clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the
sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his
total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. i
thanked my friend from my heart, but i did not speak. i saw plainly
that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from
me; and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence
that knew no bounds, yet i could never persuade myself to confide in
him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which
i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.

m. krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of
almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even
more pain than the benevolent approbation of m. waldman. “d—n
the fellow!” cried he; “why, m. clerval, i assure you he has
outstript us all. ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. a
youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in cornelius agrippa as firmly
as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if
he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—ay,
ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,
“m. frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.
young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, m. clerval: i was
myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”

m. krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned
the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.

clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his
literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. he
came to the university with the design of making himself complete
master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for
the plan of life he had marked out for himself. resolved to pursue no
inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the east, as affording
scope for his spirit of enterprise. the persian, arabic, and sanskrit
languages engaged his attention, and i was easily induced to enter on
the same studies. idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that i
wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, i felt
great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not
only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. i
did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for
i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary
amusement. i read merely to understand their meaning, and they well
repaid my labours. their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
elevating, to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of
any other country. when you read their writings, life appears to
consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns
of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. how
different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome!

summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to geneva was
fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several
accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,
and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. i felt this
delay very bitterly; for i longed to see my native town and my beloved
friends. my return had only been delayed so long, from an
unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place, before he had become
acquainted with any of its inhabitants. the winter, however, was spent
cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came
its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.

the month of may had already commenced, and i expected the letter daily
which was to fix the date of my departure, when henry proposed a
pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt, that i might bid a
personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited. i acceded
with pleasure to this proposition: i was fond of exercise, and clerval
had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature
that i had taken among the scenes of my native country.

we passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits
had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the
salubrious air i breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and
the conversation of my friend. study had before secluded me from the
intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but
clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught
me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.
excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to
elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. a selfish
pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and
affection warmed and opened my senses; i became the same happy creature
who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.
when happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most
delightful sensations. a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with
ecstasy. the present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring
bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. i
was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed
upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an
invincible burden.

henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he
exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled
his soul. the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly
astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in
imitation of the persian and arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful
fancy and passion. at other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew
me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.

we returned to our college on a sunday afternoon: the peasants were
dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. my own spirits were
high, and i bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.




chapter 7


on my return, i found the following letter from my father:—

“my dear victor,

“you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of
your return to us; and i was at first tempted to write only a few
lines, merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you. but
that would be a cruel kindness, and i dare not do it. what would be
your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to
behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? and how, victor, can
i relate our misfortune? absence cannot have rendered you callous to
our joys and griefs; and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent
son? i wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but i know it is
impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words
which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.

“william is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed
my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! victor, he is murdered!

“i will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the
circumstances of the transaction.

“last thursday (may 7th), i, my niece, and your two brothers, went to
walk in plainpalais. the evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged
our walk farther than usual. it was already dusk before we thought of
returning; and then we discovered that william and ernest, who had gone
on before, were not to be found. we accordingly rested on a seat until
they should return. presently ernest came, and enquired if we had seen
his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that william
had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and
afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.

“this account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him
until night fell, when elizabeth conjectured that he might have
returned to the house. he was not there. we returned again, with
torches; for i could not rest, when i thought that my sweet boy had
lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;
elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. about five in the morning i
discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before i had seen blooming and
active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the
print of the murder’s finger was on his neck.

“he was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my
countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth. she was very earnest to
see the corpse. at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted,
and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the
victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘o god! i have murdered my
darling child!’

“she fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. when she again
lived, it was only to weep and sigh. she told me, that that same
evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable
miniature that she possessed of your mother. this picture is gone, and
was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. we
have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him
are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved william!

“come, dearest victor; you alone can console elizabeth. she weeps
continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;
her words pierce my heart. we are all unhappy; but will not that be an
additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?
your dear mother! alas, victor! i now say, thank god she did not live
to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!

“come, victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,
but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of
festering, the wounds of our minds. enter the house of mourning, my
friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not
with hatred for your enemies.

“your affectionate and afflicted father,

“alphonse frankenstein.



“geneva, may 12th, 17—.”



clerval, who had watched my countenance as i read this letter, was
surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first
expressed on receiving new from my friends. i threw the letter on the
table, and covered my face with my hands.

“my dear frankenstein,” exclaimed henry, when he perceived me
weep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? my dear friend,
what has happened?”

i motioned him to take up the letter, while i walked up and down the
room in the extremest agitation. tears also gushed from the eyes of
clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.

“i can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;
“your disaster is irreparable. what do you intend to do?”

“to go instantly to geneva: come with me, henry, to order the horses.”

during our walk, clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;
he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “poor william!” said he,
“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! who that had
seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his
untimely loss! to die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! how
much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! poor little
fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but
he is at rest. the pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.
a sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. he can no longer
be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable
survivors.”

clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words
impressed themselves on my mind and i remembered them afterwards in
solitude. but now, as soon as the horses arrived, i hurried into a
cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.

my journey was very melancholy. at first i wished to hurry on, for i longed
to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when i
drew near my native town, i slackened my progress. i could hardly sustain
the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. i passed through
scenes familiar to my youth, but which i had not seen for nearly six years.
how altered every thing might be during that time! one sudden and
desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances
might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were
done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. fear overcame me; i
dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,
although i was unable to define them.

i remained two days at lausanne, in this painful state of mind. i
contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the
snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. by
degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and i continued my journey
towards geneva.

the road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as i
approached my native town. i discovered more distinctly the black
sides of jura, and the bright summit of mont blanc. i wept like a
child. “dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your
wanderer? your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and
placid. is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”

i fear, my friend, that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on
these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative
happiness, and i think of them with pleasure. my country, my beloved
country! who but a native can tell the delight i took in again
beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely
lake!

yet, as i drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. night also
closed around; and when i could hardly see the dark mountains, i felt still
more gloomily. the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and i
foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of human
beings. alas! i prophesied truly, and failed only in one single
circumstance, that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded, i did not
conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure.

it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva; the gates
of the town were already shut; and i was obliged to pass the night at
secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. the sky
was serene; and, as i was unable to rest, i resolved to visit the spot
where my poor william had been murdered. as i could not pass through the
town, i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais.
during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont
blanc in the most beautiful figures. the storm appeared to approach
rapidly, and, on landing, i ascended a low hill, that i might observe its
progress. it advanced; the heavens were clouded, and i soon felt the rain
coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.

i quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm
increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash
over my head. it was echoed from salêve, the juras, and the alps of
savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the
lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself
from the preceding flash. the storm, as is often the case in
switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. the
most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the
lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of
copêt. another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes; and another
darkened and sometimes disclosed the môle, a peaked mountain to the
east of the lake.

while i watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, i wandered on with
a hasty step. this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; i clasped my
hands, and exclaimed aloud, “william, dear angel! this is thy
funeral, this thy dirge!” as i said these words, i perceived in the
gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; i stood
fixed, gazing intently: i could not be mistaken. a flash of lightning
illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its
gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs
to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
dæmon, to whom i had given life. what did he there? could he be (i
shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? no sooner did that
idea cross my imagination, than i became convinced of its truth; my teeth
chattered, and i was forced to lean against a tree for support. the figure
passed me quickly, and i lost it in the gloom. nothing in human shape could
have destroyed the fair child. _he_ was the murderer! i could not
doubt it. the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the
fact. i thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for
another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly
perpendicular ascent of mont salêve, a hill that bounds plainpalais on the
south. he soon reached the summit, and disappeared.

i remained motionless. the thunder ceased; but the rain still
continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. i
revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget:
the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of
the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. two years had
now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and
was this his first crime? alas! i had turned loose into the world a
depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not
murdered my brother?

no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the
night, which i spent, cold and wet, in the open air. but i did not
feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in
scenes of evil and despair. i considered the being whom i had cast
among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes
of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light
of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced
to destroy all that was dear to me.

day dawned; and i directed my steps towards the town. the gates were
open, and i hastened to my father’s house. my first thought was to
discover what i knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be
made. but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell. a
being whom i myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at
midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. i
remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at
the time that i dated my creation, and which would give an air of
delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. i well knew that
if any other had communicated such a relation to me, i should have
looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. besides, the strange nature
of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if i were so far credited
as to persuade my relatives to commence it. and then of what use would
be pursuit? who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
overhanging sides of mont salêve? these reflections determined me, and
i resolved to remain silent.

it was about five in the morning when i entered my father’s house. i
told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library
to attend their usual hour of rising.

six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and i
stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my
departure for ingolstadt. beloved and venerable parent! he still remained
to me. i gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the
mantel-piece. it was an historical subject, painted at my father’s
desire, and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling
by the coffin of her dead father. her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;
but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
sentiment of pity. below this picture was a miniature of william; and my
tears flowed when i looked upon it. while i was thus engaged, ernest
entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:
“welcome, my dearest victor,” said he. “ah! i wish you
had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and
delighted. you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can
alleviate; yet your presence will, i hope, revive our father, who seems
sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor
elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—poor
william! he was our darling and our pride!”

tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal
agony crept over my frame. before, i had only imagined the
wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and
a not less terrible, disaster. i tried to calm ernest; i enquired more
minutely concerning my father, and here i named my cousin.

“she most of all,” said ernest, “requires consolation; she accused
herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her
very wretched. but since the murderer has been discovered—”

“the murderer discovered! good god! how can that be? who could attempt
to pursue him? it is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the
winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. i saw him too; he
was free last night!”

“i do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of
wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. no
one would believe it at first; and even now elizabeth will not be
convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. indeed, who would credit
that justine moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,
could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”

“justine moritz! poor, poor girl, is she the accused? but it is
wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, ernest?”

“no one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have
almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so
confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, i fear,
leaves no hope for doubt. but she will be tried today, and you will
then hear all.”

he then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor william
had been discovered, justine had been taken ill, and confined to her
bed for several days. during this interval, one of the servants,
happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the
murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which
had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. the servant
instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to
any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,
justine was apprehended. on being charged with the fact, the poor girl
confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
manner.

this was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and i replied
earnestly, “you are all mistaken; i know the murderer. justine, poor,
good justine, is innocent.”

at that instant my father entered. i saw unhappiness deeply impressed
on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,
after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
some other topic than that of our disaster, had not ernest exclaimed,
“good god, papa! victor says that he knows who was the murderer of
poor william.”

“we do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed i had
rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much
depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly.”

“my dear father, you are mistaken; justine is innocent.”

“if she is, god forbid that she should suffer as guilty. she is to be
tried today, and i hope, i sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”

this speech calmed me. i was firmly convinced in my own mind that
justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. i
had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be
brought forward strong enough to convict her. my tale was not one to
announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as
madness by the vulgar. did any one indeed exist, except i, the
creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the
existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance
which i had let loose upon the world?

we were soon joined by elizabeth. time had altered her since i last
beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of
her childish years. there was the same candour, the same vivacity, but
it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.
she welcomed me with the greatest affection. “your arrival, my dear
cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. you perhaps will find some
means to justify my poor guiltless justine. alas! who is safe, if she
be convicted of crime? i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do
upon my own. our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only
lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom i sincerely
love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. if she is condemned, i
never shall know joy more. but she will not, i am sure she will not;
and then i shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little
william.”

“she is innocent, my elizabeth,” said i, “and that shall
be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance
of her acquittal.”

“how kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,
and that made me wretched, for i knew that it was impossible: and to
see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me
hopeless and despairing.” she wept.

“dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. if she
is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the
activity with which i shall prevent the slightest shadow of
partiality.”




chapter 8


we passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to
commence. my father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend
as witnesses, i accompanied them to the court. during the whole of
this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture. it was to
be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would
cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of
innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every
aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised
to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an
ignominious grave, and i the cause! a thousand times rather would i
have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine, but i
was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have
been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have
exculpated her who suffered through me.

the appearance of justine was calm. she was dressed in mourning, and
her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her
feelings, exquisitely beautiful. yet she appeared confident in
innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by
thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have
excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the
imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. she
was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as
her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she
worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. when she entered the
court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were
seated. a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly
recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest
her utter guiltlessness.

the trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the
charge, several witnesses were called. several strange facts combined
against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof
of her innocence as i had. she had been out the whole of the night on
which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been
perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the
murdered child had been afterwards found. the woman asked her what she
did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused
and unintelligible answer. she returned to the house about eight
o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she
replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly
if anything had been heard concerning him. when shown the body, she
fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. the
picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;
and when elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same
which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round
his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.

justine was called on for her defence. as the trial had proceeded, her
countenance had altered. surprise, horror, and misery were strongly
expressed. sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was
desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible
although variable voice.

“god knows,” she said, “how entirely i am innocent. but i
do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; i rest my innocence
on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced
against me, and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my
judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears
doubtful or suspicious.”

she then related that, by the permission of elizabeth, she had passed
the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the
house of an aunt at chêne, a village situated at about a league from
geneva. on her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked
her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. she was
alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,
when the gates of geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain
several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being
unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. most
of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that
she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.
it was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour
to find my brother. if she had gone near the spot where his body lay,
it was without her knowledge. that she had been bewildered when
questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed
a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain.
concerning the picture she could give no account.

“i know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and
fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but i have no power of
explaining it; and when i have expressed my utter ignorance, i am only left
to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been
placed in my pocket. but here also i am checked. i believe that i have no
enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me
wantonly. did the murderer place it there? i know of no opportunity
afforded him for so doing; or, if i had, why should he have stolen the
jewel, to part with it again so soon?

“i commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet i see no room for
hope. i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my
character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
guilt, i must be condemned, although i would pledge my salvation on my
innocence.”

several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and
they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they
supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come
forward. elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent
dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,
when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address
the court.

“i am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who
was murdered, or rather his sister, for i was educated by and have lived
with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. it may
therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but
when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
pretended friends, i wish to be allowed to speak, that i may say what i
know of her character. i am well acquainted with the accused. i have lived
in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly
two years. during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and
benevolent of human creatures. she nursed madame frankenstein, my aunt, in
her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards
attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited
the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my
uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. she was
warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a
most affectionate mother. for my own part, i do not hesitate to say that,
notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, i believe and rely
on her perfect innocence. she had no temptation for such an action; as to
the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,
i should have willingly given it to her, so much do i esteem and value
her.”

a murmur of approbation followed elizabeth’s simple and powerful
appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in
favour of poor justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with
renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. she
herself wept as elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. my own
agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. i believed
in her innocence; i knew it. could the dæmon who had (i did not for a
minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have
betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? i could not sustain the
horror of my situation, and when i perceived that the popular voice and
the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,
i rushed out of the court in agony. the tortures of the accused did
not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of
remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.

i passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. in the morning i went to
the court; my lips and throat were parched. i dared not ask the fatal
question, but i was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my
visit. the ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and justine
was condemned.

i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt. i had before
experienced sensations of horror, and i have endeavoured to bestow upon
them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the
heart-sickening despair that i then endured. the person to whom i
addressed myself added that justine had already confessed her guilt.
“that evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a
case, but i am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to
condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so
decisive.”

this was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? had
my eyes deceived me? and was i really as mad as the whole world would
believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions? i
hastened to return home, and elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.

“my cousin,” replied i, “it is decided as you may have expected; all
judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty
should escape. but she has confessed.”

this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon
justine’s innocence. “alas!” said she. “how shall i
ever again believe in human goodness? justine, whom i loved and esteemed as
my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has
committed a murder.”

soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my
cousin. my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own
judgment and feelings to decide. “yes,” said elizabeth,
“i will go, although she is guilty; and you, victor, shall accompany
me; i cannot go alone.” the idea of this visit was torture to me, yet
i could not refuse.

we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some
straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on
her knees. she rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with
her, she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth, weeping bitterly. my
cousin wept also.

“oh, justine!” said she. “why did you rob me of my last consolation?
i relied on your innocence, and although i was then very wretched, i
was not so miserable as i am now.”

“and do you also believe that i am so very, very wicked? do you also
join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” her
voice was suffocated with sobs.

“rise, my poor girl,” said elizabeth; “why do you kneel,
if you are innocent? i am not one of your enemies, i believed you
guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until i heard that you had
yourself declared your guilt. that report, you say, is false; and be
assured, dear justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a
moment, but your own confession.”

“i did confess, but i confessed a lie. i confessed, that i might
obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than
all my other sins. the god of heaven forgive me! ever since i was
condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,
until i almost began to think that i was the monster that he said i
was. he threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if
i continued obdurate. dear lady, i had none to support me; all looked
on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. what could i do?
in an evil hour i subscribed to a lie; and now only am i truly
miserable.”

she paused, weeping, and then continued, “i thought with horror, my
sweet lady, that you should believe your justine, whom your blessed
aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable
of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
dear william! dearest blessed child! i soon shall see you again in
heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as i
am to suffer ignominy and death.”

“oh, justine! forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.
why did you confess? but do not mourn, dear girl. do not fear. i
will proclaim, i will prove your innocence. i will melt the stony
hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. you shall not die!
you, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!
no! no! i never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”

justine shook her head mournfully. “i do not fear to die,” she said;
“that pang is past. god raises my weakness and gives me courage to
endure the worst. i leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember
me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, i am resigned to the
fate awaiting me. learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to
the will of heaven!”

during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room,
where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. despair!
who dared talk of that? the poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass
the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as i did, such
deep and bitter agony. i gnashed my teeth and ground them together,
uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. justine started. when
she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “dear sir, you are very
kind to visit me; you, i hope, do not believe that i am guilty?”

i could not answer. “no, justine,” said elizabeth; “he is more
convinced of your innocence than i was, for even when he heard that you
had confessed, he did not credit it.”

“i truly thank him. in these last moments i feel the sincerest
gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. how sweet is
the affection of others to such a wretch as i am! it removes more than
half my misfortune, and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my
innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”

thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. she indeed
gained the resignation she desired. but i, the true murderer, felt the
never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or
consolation. elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was
the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair
moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. anguish and
despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; i bore a hell within
me which nothing could extinguish. we stayed several hours with
justine, and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear
herself away. “i wish,” cried she, “that i were to die with you; i
cannot live in this world of misery.”

justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty
repressed her bitter tears. she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice
of half-suppressed emotion, “farewell, sweet lady, dearest elizabeth,
my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and
preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever
suffer! live, and be happy, and make others so.”

and on the morrow justine died. elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence
failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the
criminality of the saintly sufferer. my passionate and indignant
appeals were lost upon them. and when i received their cold answers
and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed
avowal died away on my lips. thus i might proclaim myself a madman,
but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. she
perished on the scaffold as a murderess!

from the tortures of my own heart, i turned to contemplate the deep and
voiceless grief of my elizabeth. this also was my doing! and my
father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was
the work of my thrice-accursed hands! ye weep, unhappy ones, but these
are not your last tears! again shall you raise the funeral wail, and
the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!
frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he
who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no
thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear
countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life
in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond
his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction
pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!

thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,
i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and
justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.




chapter 9


nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have
been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of
inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope
and fear. justine died, she rested, and i was alive. the blood flowed
freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my
heart which nothing could remove. sleep fled from my eyes; i wandered
like an evil spirit, for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond
description horrible, and more, much more (i persuaded myself) was yet
behind. yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.
i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment
when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow
beings. now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience
which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and
from thence to gather promise of new hopes, i was seized by remorse and
the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures
such as no language can describe.

this state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never
entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. i shunned
the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;
solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.

my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition
and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his
serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and
awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.
“do you think, victor,” said he, “that i do not suffer
also? no one could love a child more than i loved your
brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but
is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting
their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? it is also a duty
owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,
or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for
society.”

this advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; i
should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if
remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my
other sensations. now i could only answer my father with a look of
despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.

about this time we retired to our house at belrive. this change was
particularly agreeable to me. the shutting of the gates regularly at
ten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that
hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome
to me. i was now free. often, after the rest of the family had
retired for the night, i took the boat and passed many hours upon the
water. sometimes, with my sails set, i was carried by the wind; and
sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, i left the boat to
pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. i
was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and i the only
unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and
heavenly—if i except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and
interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shore—often,
i say, i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters
might close over me and my calamities for ever. but i was restrained,
when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth, whom i tenderly
loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. i thought also of my
father and surviving brother; should i by my base desertion leave them
exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose
among them?

at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my
mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness. but that
could not be. remorse extinguished every hope. i had been the author of
unalterable evils, and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i had
created should perpetrate some new wickedness. i had an obscure feeling
that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,
which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
there was always scope for fear so long as anything i loved remained
behind. my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. when i thought of
him i gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and i ardently wished to
extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessly bestowed. when i
reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds
of moderation. i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the
andes, could i, when there, have precipitated him to their base. i wished
to see him again, that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his
head and avenge the deaths of william and justine.

our house was the house of mourning. my father’s health was deeply
shaken by the horror of the recent events. elizabeth was sad and
desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all
pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she
then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted
and destroyed. she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth
wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our
future prospects. the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from
the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest
smiles.

“when i reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of
justine moritz, i no longer see the world and its works as they before
appeared to me. before, i looked upon the accounts of vice and
injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient
days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to
reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men
appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. yet i am
certainly unjust. everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and
if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly
she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. for the sake
of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,
a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if
it had been her own! i could not consent to the death of any human
being, but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to
remain in the society of men. but she was innocent. i know, i feel
she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.
alas! victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can
assure themselves of certain happiness? i feel as if i were walking on
the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and
endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. william and justine were
assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,
and perhaps respected. but even if i were condemned to suffer on the
scaffold for the same crimes, i would not change places with such a
wretch.”

i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. i, not in deed,
but in effect, was the true murderer. elizabeth read my anguish in my
countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “my dearest friend, you
must calm yourself. these events have affected me, god knows how
deeply; but i am not so wretched as you are. there is an expression of
despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me
tremble. dear victor, banish these dark passions. remember the
friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. have we lost
the power of rendering you happy? ah! while we love, while we are
true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native
country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our
peace?”

and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every
other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my
heart? even as she spoke i drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at
that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.

thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of
heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were
ineffectual. i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial
influence could penetrate. the wounded deer dragging its fainting
limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had
pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.

sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but
sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily
exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable
sensations. it was during an access of this kind that i suddenly left
my home, and bending my steps towards the near alpine valleys, sought
in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and
my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. my wanderings were directed
towards the valley of chamounix. i had visited it frequently during my
boyhood. six years had passed since then: _i_ was a wreck, but nought
had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.

i performed the first part of my journey on horseback. i afterwards
hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive
injury on these rugged roads. the weather was fine; it was about the
middle of the month of august, nearly two months after the death of
justine, that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe. the
weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in
the ravine of arve. the immense mountains and precipices that overhung
me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and
the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as
omnipotence—and i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less
almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here
displayed in their most terrific guise. still, as i ascended higher,
the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.
ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the
impetuous arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from
among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. but it was
augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps, whose white and
shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another
earth, the habitations of another race of beings.

i passed the bridge of pélissier, where the ravine, which the river
forms, opened before me, and i began to ascend the mountain that
overhangs it. soon after, i entered the valley of chamounix. this
valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and
picturesque as that of servox, through which i had just passed. the
high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but i saw no
more ruined castles and fertile fields. immense glaciers approached
the road; i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and
marked the smoke of its passage. mont blanc, the supreme and
magnificent mont blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,
and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.

a tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this
journey. some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and
recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the
lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. the very winds whispered in soothing
accents, and maternal nature bade me weep no more. then again the
kindly influence ceased to act—i found myself fettered again to grief
and indulging in all the misery of reflection. then i spurred on my
animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,
myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, i alighted and threw myself on
the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.

at length i arrived at the village of chamounix. exhaustion succeeded
to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured.
for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid
lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of
the arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. the same lulling sounds
acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when i placed my head
upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; i felt it as it came and blessed
the giver of oblivion.




chapter 10


i spent the following day roaming through the valley. i stood beside
the sources of the arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that
with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to
barricade the valley. the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before
me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were
scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling
waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the
avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the
accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,
was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
their hands. these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the
greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving. they elevated me
from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my
grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. in some degree, also, they
diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the
last month. i retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,
waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which i
had contemplated during the day. they congregated round me; the
unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,
and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all
gathered round me and bade me be at peace.

where had they fled when the next morning i awoke? all of
soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every
thought. the rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the
summits of the mountains, so that i even saw not the faces of those
mighty friends. still i would penetrate their misty veil and seek them
in their cloudy retreats. what were rain and storm to me? my mule was
brought to the door, and i resolved to ascend to the summit of
montanvert. i remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous
and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when i first saw it.
it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the
soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
the sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the
effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing
cares of life. i determined to go without a guide, for i was well
acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the
solitary grandeur of the scene.

the ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short
windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the
mountain. it is a scene terrifically desolate. in a thousand spots
the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie
broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,
leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon
other trees. the path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is
particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking
in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw
destruction upon the head of the speaker. the pines are not tall or
luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.
i looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers
which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain
poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i
received from the objects around me. alas! why does man boast of
sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders
them more necessary beings. if our impulses were confined to hunger,
thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by
every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may
convey to us.

  we rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
     we rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.
  we feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
     embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
  it is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,
     the path of its departure still is free.
  man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;
     nought may endure but mutability!


it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent. for some
time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. a mist covered
both that and the surrounding mountains. presently a breeze dissipated
the cloud, and i descended upon the glacier. the surface is very
uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and
interspersed by rifts that sink deep. the field of ice is almost a
league in width, but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it. the
opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. from the side where i
now stood montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;
and above it rose mont blanc, in awful majesty. i remained in a recess
of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. the sea,
or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,
whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. their icy and glittering
peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. my heart, which was
before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; i exclaimed,
“wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow
beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,
away from the joys of life.”

as i said this i suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
advancing towards me with superhuman speed. he bounded over the
crevices in the ice, among which i had walked with caution; his
stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. i was
troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and i felt a faintness seize me,
but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. i
perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)
that it was the wretch whom i had created. i trembled with rage and
horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in
mortal combat. he approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. but i scarcely
observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,
and i recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious
detestation and contempt.

“devil,” i exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? and do
not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?
begone, vile insect! or rather, stay, that i may trample you to dust! and,
oh! that i could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore
those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”

“i expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “all men hate the
wretched; how, then, must i be hated, who am miserable beyond all
living things! yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,
to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of
one of us. you purpose to kill me. how dare you sport thus with life?
do your duty towards me, and i will do mine towards you and the rest of
mankind. if you will comply with my conditions, i will leave them and
you at peace; but if you refuse, i will glut the maw of death, until it
be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”

“abhorred monster! fiend that thou art! the tortures of hell are too
mild a vengeance for thy crimes. wretched devil! you reproach me with
your creation, come on, then, that i may extinguish the spark which i
so negligently bestowed.”

my rage was without bounds; i sprang on him, impelled by all the
feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.

he easily eluded me and said,

“be calm! i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred
on my devoted head. have i not suffered enough, that you seek to
increase my misery? life, although it may only be an accumulation of
anguish, is dear to me, and i will defend it. remember, thou hast made
me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my
joints more supple. but i will not be tempted to set myself in
opposition to thee. i am thy creature, and i will be even mild and
docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,
the which thou owest me. oh, frankenstein, be not equitable to every
other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy
clemency and affection, is most due. remember that i am thy creature;
i ought to be thy adam, but i am rather the fallen angel, whom thou
drivest from joy for no misdeed. everywhere i see bliss, from which i
alone am irrevocably excluded. i was benevolent and good; misery made
me a fiend. make me happy, and i shall again be virtuous.”

“begone! i will not hear you. there can be no community between you
and me; we are enemies. begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,
in which one must fall.”

“how can i move thee? will no entreaties cause thee to turn a
favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and
compassion? believe me, frankenstein, i was benevolent; my soul glowed
with love and humanity; but am i not alone, miserably alone? you, my
creator, abhor me; what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures,
who owe me nothing? they spurn and hate me. the desert mountains and
dreary glaciers are my refuge. i have wandered here many days; the
caves of ice, which i only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the
only one which man does not grudge. these bleak skies i hail, for they
are kinder to me than your fellow beings. if the multitude of mankind
knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for
my destruction. shall i not then hate them who abhor me? i will keep
no terms with my enemies. i am miserable, and they shall share my
wretchedness. yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver
them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that
not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be
swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. let your compassion be
moved, and do not disdain me. listen to my tale; when you have heard
that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that i deserve.
but hear me. the guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they
are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. listen
to me, frankenstein. you accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with
a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. oh, praise the
eternal justice of man! yet i ask you not to spare me; listen to me,
and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”

“why do you call to my remembrance,” i rejoined, “circumstances of
which i shudder to reflect, that i have been the miserable origin and
author? cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw
light! cursed (although i curse myself) be the hands that formed you!
you have made me wretched beyond expression. you have left me no power
to consider whether i am just to you or not. begone! relieve me from
the sight of your detested form.”

“thus i relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands
before my eyes, which i flung from me with violence; “thus i take from
thee a sight which you abhor. still thou canst listen to me and grant
me thy compassion. by the virtues that i once possessed, i demand this
from you. hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of
this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon
the mountain. the sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends
to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another
world, you will have heard my story and can decide. on you it rests,
whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless
life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of
your own speedy ruin.”

as he said this he led the way across the ice; i followed. my heart
was full, and i did not answer him, but as i proceeded, i weighed the
various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to
his tale. i was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my
resolution. i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my
brother, and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.
for the first time, also, i felt what the duties of a creator towards
his creature were, and that i ought to render him happy before i
complained of his wickedness. these motives urged me to comply with
his demand. we crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite
rock. the air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we
entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, i with a heavy
heart and depressed spirits. but i consented to listen, and seating
myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began
his tale.




chapter 11


“it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of
my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and i saw, felt, heard,
and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before i
learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. by
degrees, i remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that i
was obliged to shut my eyes. darkness then came over me and troubled
me, but hardly had i felt this when, by opening my eyes, as i now
suppose, the light poured in upon me again. i walked and, i believe,
descended, but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations.
before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my
touch or sight; but i now found that i could wander on at liberty, with
no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid. the light
became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as i
walked, i sought a place where i could receive shade. this was the
forest near ingolstadt; and here i lay by the side of a brook resting
from my fatigue, until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst. this
roused me from my nearly dormant state, and i ate some berries which i
found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. i slaked my thirst
at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.

“it was dark when i awoke; i felt cold also, and half frightened, as it
were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. before i had quitted
your apartment, on a sensation of cold, i had covered myself with some
clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of
night. i was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; i knew, and could
distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, i sat
down and wept.

“soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of
pleasure. i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the
trees. [the moon] i gazed with a kind of wonder. it moved slowly,
but it enlightened my path, and i again went out in search of berries.
i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak, with
which i covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. no distinct
ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. i felt light, and hunger,
and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on
all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that i could
distinguish was the bright moon, and i fixed my eyes on that with
pleasure.

“several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had
greatly lessened, when i began to distinguish my sensations from each
other. i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with
drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. i was delighted
when i first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my
ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had
often intercepted the light from my eyes. i began also to observe,
with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the
boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. sometimes i
tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.
sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the
uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into
silence again.

“the moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened
form, showed itself, while i still remained in the forest. my
sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every
day additional ideas. my eyes became accustomed to the light and to
perceive objects in their right forms; i distinguished the insect from
the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. i found that the
sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and
thrush were sweet and enticing.

“one day, when i was oppressed by cold, i found a fire which had been
left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the
warmth i experienced from it. in my joy i thrust my hand into the live
embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. how strange,
i thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! i
examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be
composed of wood. i quickly collected some branches, but they were wet
and would not burn. i was pained at this and sat still watching the
operation of the fire. the wet wood which i had placed near the heat
dried and itself became inflamed. i reflected on this, and by touching
the various branches, i discovered the cause and busied myself in
collecting a great quantity of wood, that i might dry it and have a
plentiful supply of fire. when night came on and brought sleep with
it, i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. i
covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches
upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, i lay on the ground and sank
into sleep.

“it was morning when i awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.
i uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. i
observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the
embers when they were nearly extinguished. when night came again i
found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that
the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for i found
some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and
tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees. i
tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on
the live embers. i found that the berries were spoiled by this
operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.

“food, however, became scarce, and i often spent the whole day
searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. when
i found this, i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto
inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be
more easily satisfied. in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the
loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how
to reproduce it. i gave several hours to the serious consideration of
this difficulty, but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply
it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, i struck across the wood
towards the setting sun. i passed three days in these rambles and at
length discovered the open country. a great fall of snow had taken
place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the
appearance was disconsolate, and i found my feet chilled by the cold
damp substance that covered the ground.

“it was about seven in the morning, and i longed to obtain food and
shelter; at length i perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which
had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. this
was a new sight to me, and i examined the structure with great
curiosity. finding the door open, i entered. an old man sat in it,
near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. he turned on
hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the
hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form
hardly appeared capable. his appearance, different from any i had ever
before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. but i was enchanted
by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not
penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite
and divine a retreat as pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell
after their sufferings in the lake of fire. i greedily devoured the
remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,
milk, and wine; the latter, however, i did not like. then, overcome by
fatigue, i lay down among some straw and fell asleep.

“it was noon when i awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which
shone brightly on the white ground, i determined to recommence my
travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a
wallet i found, i proceeded across the fields for several hours, until
at sunset i arrived at a village. how miraculous did this appear! the
huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by
turns. the vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that i saw
placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. one
of the best of these i entered, but i had hardly placed my foot within
the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.
the whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,
grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, i
escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,
quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had
beheld in the village. this hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat
and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, i
dared not enter it. my place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so
low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it. no wood, however,
was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and
although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, i found it an
agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.

“here, then, i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,
however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more
from the barbarity of man. as soon as morning dawned i crept from my
kennel, that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could
remain in the habitation i had found. it was situated against the back
of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig
sty and a clear pool of water. one part was open, and by that i had
crept in; but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived
with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that i might move them on
occasion to pass out; all the light i enjoyed came through the sty, and
that was sufficient for me.

“having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, i
retired, for i saw the figure of a man at a distance, and i remembered
too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. i
had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf
of coarse bread, which i purloined, and a cup with which i could drink
more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by
my retreat. the floor was a little raised, so that it was kept
perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was
tolerably warm.

“being thus provided, i resolved to reside in this hovel until
something should occur which might alter my determination. it was
indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,
the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. i ate my breakfast with
pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little
water when i heard a step, and looking through a small chink, i beheld
a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. the
girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what i have since found
cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. yet she was meanly dressed, a
coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair
hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. i lost
sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing
the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. as she walked along,
seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose
countenance expressed a deeper despondence. uttering a few sounds with
an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the
cottage himself. she followed, and they disappeared. presently i saw
the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field
behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the
house and sometimes in the yard.

“on examining my dwelling, i found that one of the windows of the
cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been
filled up with wood. in one of these was a small and almost
imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.
through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean
but very bare of furniture. in one corner, near a small fire, sat an
old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. the
young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she
took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat
down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play
and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the
nightingale. it was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had
never beheld aught beautiful before. the silver hair and benevolent
countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle
manners of the girl enticed my love. he played a sweet mournful air
which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of
which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then
pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt
at his feet. he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection
that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were
a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as i had never before experienced,
either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and i withdrew from the
window, unable to bear these emotions.

“soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a
load of wood. the girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of
his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on
the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,
and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. she seemed
pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she
placed in water, and then upon the fire. she afterwards continued her
work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily
employed in digging and pulling up roots. after he had been employed
thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the
cottage together.

“the old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance
of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to
eat. the meal was quickly dispatched. the young woman was again
occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the
cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.
nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent
creatures. one was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming
with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his
figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his
eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. the
old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different
from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the
fields.

“night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, i found that the
cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was
delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the
pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours. in the evening
the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations
which i did not understand; and the old man again took up the
instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in
the morning. so soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,
but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the
harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; i since
found that he read aloud, but at that time i knew nothing of the
science of words or letters.

“the family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,
extinguished their lights and retired, as i conjectured, to rest.”




chapter 12


“i lay on my straw, but i could not sleep. i thought of the
occurrences of the day. what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners
of these people, and i longed to join them, but dared not. i
remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from
the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct i
might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present i would
remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the
motives which influenced their actions.

“the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. the young woman
arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed
after the first meal.

“this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.
the young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in
various laborious occupations within. the old man, whom i soon
perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or
in contemplation. nothing could exceed the love and respect which the
younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. they
performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with
gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.

“they were not entirely happy. the young man and his companion often
went apart and appeared to weep. i saw no cause for their unhappiness,
but i was deeply affected by it. if such lovely creatures were
miserable, it was less strange that i, an imperfect and solitary being,
should be wretched. yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? they
possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every
luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands
when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,
they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day
looks of affection and kindness. what did their tears imply? did they
really express pain? i was at first unable to solve these questions,
but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which
were at first enigmatic.

“a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one of the causes of
the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they
suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. their nourishment
consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of
one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters
could scarcely procure food to support it. they often, i believe,
suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two
younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old
man when they reserved none for themselves.

“this trait of kindness moved me sensibly. i had been accustomed,
during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own
consumption, but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on
the cottagers, i abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and
roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood.

“i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist
their labours. i found that the youth spent a great part of each day
in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night i often
took his tools, the use of which i quickly discovered, and brought home
firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.

“i remember, the first time that i did this, the young woman, when she
opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great
pile of wood on the outside. she uttered some words in a loud voice, and the
youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. i observed, with pleasure,
that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the
cottage and cultivating the garden.

“by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment. i found that
these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and
feelings to one another by articulate sounds. i perceived that the words
they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the
minds and countenances of the hearers. this was indeed a godlike science,
and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it. but i was baffled in
every attempt i made for this purpose. their pronunciation was quick, and
the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible
objects, i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the
mystery of their reference. by great application, however, and after having
remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, i
discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of
discourse; i learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and
_wood._ i learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. the youth
and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only
one, which was _father._ the girl was called _sister_ or
_agatha,_ and the youth _felix, brother,_ or _son_. i cannot
describe the delight i felt when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of
these sounds and was able to pronounce them. i distinguished several other
words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,
dearest, unhappy._

“i spent the winter in this manner. the gentle manners and beauty of
the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, i
felt depressed; when they rejoiced, i sympathised in their joys. i saw
few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the
cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the
superior accomplishments of my friends. the old man, i could perceive,
often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes i found that
he called them, to cast off their melancholy. he would talk in a
cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure
even upon me. agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled
with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but i
generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after
having listened to the exhortations of her father. it was not thus
with felix. he was always the saddest of the group, and even to my
unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his
friends. but if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more
cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old
man.

“i could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked
the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. in the midst of poverty
and want, felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little
white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. early in
the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that
obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and
brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual
astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible
hand. in the day, i believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring
farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,
yet brought no wood with him. at other times he worked in the garden,
but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old
man and agatha.

“this reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees i
discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when
he talked. i conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs
for speech which he understood, and i ardently longed to comprehend
these also; but how was that possible when i did not even understand
the sounds for which they stood as signs? i improved, however,
sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of
conversation, although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for i
easily perceived that, although i eagerly longed to discover myself to
the cottagers, i ought not to make the attempt until i had first become
master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them
overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast
perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.

“i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,
and delicate complexions; but how was i terrified when i viewed myself
in a transparent pool! at first i started back, unable to believe that
it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror; and when i became
fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am, i was
filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.
alas! i did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable
deformity.

“as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow
vanished, and i beheld the bare trees and the black earth. from this
time felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of
impending famine disappeared. their food, as i afterwards found, was
coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.
several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they
dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season
advanced.

“the old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did
not rain, as i found it was called when the heavens poured forth its
waters. this frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the
earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.

“my mode of life in my hovel was uniform. during the morning i
attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in
various occupations, i slept; the remainder of the day was spent in
observing my friends. when they had retired to rest, if there was any
moon or the night was star-light, i went into the woods and collected
my own food and fuel for the cottage. when i returned, as often as it
was necessary, i cleared their path from the snow and performed those
offices that i had seen done by felix. i afterwards found that these
labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and
once or twice i heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good
spirit, wonderful_; but i did not then understand the signification
of these terms.

“my thoughts now became more active, and i longed to discover the
motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; i was inquisitive to
know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad. i thought
(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to
these deserving people. when i slept or was absent, the forms of the
venerable blind father, the gentle agatha, and the excellent felix
flitted before me. i looked upon them as superior beings who would be
the arbiters of my future destiny. i formed in my imagination a
thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of
me. i imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle
demeanour and conciliating words, i should first win their favour and
afterwards their love.

“these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to
the acquiring the art of language. my organs were indeed harsh, but
supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their
tones, yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease.
it was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose
intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved
better treatment than blows and execration.

“the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the
aspect of the earth. men who before this change seemed to have been
hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of
cultivation. the birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves
began to bud forth on the trees. happy, happy earth! fit habitation
for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and
unwholesome. my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of
nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,
and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”




chapter 13


“i now hasten to the more moving part of my story. i shall relate
events that impressed me with feelings which, from what i had been,
have made me what i am.

“spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies
cloudless. it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy
should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. my
senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and
a thousand sights of beauty.

“it was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested
from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children
listened to him—that i observed the countenance of felix was
melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father
paused in his music, and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired
the cause of his son’s sorrow. felix replied in a cheerful accent, and
the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.

“it was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.
the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black
veil. agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by
pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of felix. her voice was
musical but unlike that of either of my friends. on hearing this word,
felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her
veil, and i beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. her
hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were
dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular
proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with
a lovely pink.

“felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of
sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of
ecstatic joy, of which i could hardly have believed it capable; his
eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment i
thought him as beautiful as the stranger. she appeared affected by
different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held
out her hand to felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as
well as i could distinguish, his sweet arabian. she did not appear to
understand him, but smiled. he assisted her to dismount, and
dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. some
conversation took place between him and his father, and the young
stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,
but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.

“i soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds
and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood
by nor herself understood the cottagers. they made many signs which i
did not comprehend, but i saw that her presence diffused gladness
through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the
morning mists. felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of
delight welcomed his arabian. agatha, the ever-gentle agatha, kissed
the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made
signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she
came. some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,
expressed joy, the cause of which i did not comprehend. presently i
found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger
repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;
and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the
same instructions to the same end. the stranger learned about twenty
words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which i had
before understood, but i profited by the others.

“as night came on, agatha and the arabian retired early. when they
separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘good night
sweet safie.’ he sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and
by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely
guest was the subject of their conversation. i ardently desired to
understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found
it utterly impossible.

“the next morning felix went out to his work, and after the usual
occupations of agatha were finished, the arabian sat at the feet of the
old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly
beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my
eyes. she sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or
dying away like a nightingale of the woods.

“when she had finished, she gave the guitar to agatha, who at first
declined it. she played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in
sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. the old
man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to
explain to safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she
bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.

“the days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration
that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.
safie was always gay and happy; she and i improved rapidly in the
knowledge of language, so that in two months i began to comprehend most
of the words uttered by my protectors.

“in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and
the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the
scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;
the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal
rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably
shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for i never
ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same
treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered.

“my days were spent in close attention, that i might more speedily
master the language; and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than
the arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken
accents, whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that
was spoken.

“while i improved in speech, i also learned the science of letters as
it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field
for wonder and delight.

“the book from which felix instructed safie was volney’s _ruins
of empires_. i should not have understood the purport of this book had not
felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. he had chosen this
work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the
eastern authors. through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of history
and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave
me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different
nations of the earth. i heard of the slothful asiatics, of the stupendous
genius and mental activity of the grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue
of the early romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the
decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, christianity, and kings. i heard
of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over the
hapless fate of its original inhabitants.

“these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. was
man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so
vicious and base? he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil
principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and
godlike. to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour
that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on
record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more
abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. for a long time i
could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or
even why there were laws and governments; but when i heard details of
vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and
loathing.

“every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.
while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the
arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. i
heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid
poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.

“the words induced me to turn towards myself. i learned that the
possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and
unsullied descent united with riches. a man might be respected with
only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,
except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to
waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! and what was i? of
my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant, but i knew that i
possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. i was, besides,
endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; i was not even
of the same nature as man. i was more agile than they and could
subsist upon coarser diet; i bore the extremes of heat and cold with
less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. when i looked
around i saw and heard of none like me. was i, then, a monster, a blot
upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?

“i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted
upon me; i tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with
knowledge. oh, that i had for ever remained in my native wood, nor
known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!

“of what a strange nature is knowledge! it clings to the mind when it
has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. i wished sometimes to
shake off all thought and feeling, but i learned that there was but one
means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state
which i feared yet did not understand. i admired virtue and good
feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my
cottagers, but i was shut out from intercourse with them, except
through means which i obtained by stealth, when i was unseen and
unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of
becoming one among my fellows. the gentle words of agatha and the
animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me. the mild
exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved
felix were not for me. miserable, unhappy wretch!

“other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. i heard of the
difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the
father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the
older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up
in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained
knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which
bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.

“but where were my friends and relations? no father had watched my
infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if
they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which i
distinguished nothing. from my earliest remembrance i had been as i
then was in height and proportion. i had never yet seen a being
resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. what was i? the
question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.

“i will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to
return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various
feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated
in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so i loved, in
an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”




chapter 14


“some time elapsed before i learned the history of my friends. it was
one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding
as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to
one so utterly inexperienced as i was.

“the name of the old man was de lacey. he was descended from a good
family in france, where he had lived for many years in affluence,
respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. his son was bred
in the service of his country, and agatha had ranked with ladies of the
highest distinction. a few months before my arrival they had lived in
a large and luxurious city called paris, surrounded by friends and
possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or
taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.

“the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin. he was a
turkish merchant and had inhabited paris for many years, when, for some
reason which i could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.
he was seized and cast into prison the very day that safie arrived from
constantinople to join him. he was tried and condemned to death. the
injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all paris was indignant;
and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime
alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.

“felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and
indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the
court. he made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then
looked around for the means. after many fruitless attempts to gain
admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the
unfortunate muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the
execution of the barbarous sentence. felix visited the grate at night
and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. the turk,
amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer
by promises of reward and wealth. felix rejected his offers with
contempt, yet when he saw the lovely safie, who was allowed to visit
her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the
youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed
a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.

“the turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made
on the heart of felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in
his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he
should be conveyed to a place of safety. felix was too delicate to
accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the
event as to the consummation of his happiness.

“during the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for
the escape of the merchant, the zeal of felix was warmed by several
letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to
express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old
man, a servant of her father who understood french. she thanked him in
the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and
at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.

“i have copies of these letters, for i found means, during my residence
in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters
were often in the hands of felix or agatha. before i depart i will
give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,
as the sun is already far declined, i shall only have time to repeat
the substance of them to you.

“safie related that her mother was a christian arab, seized and made a
slave by the turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of
the father of safie, who married her. the young girl spoke in high and
enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the
bondage to which she was now reduced. she instructed her daughter in
the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of
intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female
followers of muhammad. this lady died, but her lessons were indelibly
impressed on the mind of safie, who sickened at the prospect of again
returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,
allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to
the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble
emulation for virtue. the prospect of marrying a christian and
remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in
society was enchanting to her.

“the day for the execution of the turk was fixed, but on the night
previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant
many leagues from paris. felix had procured passports in the name of
his father, sister, and himself. he had previously communicated his
plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under
the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in
an obscure part of paris.

“felix conducted the fugitives through france to lyons and across mont
cenis to leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable
opportunity of passing into some part of the turkish dominions.

“safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his
departure, before which time the turk renewed his promise that she
should be united to his deliverer; and felix remained with them in
expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society
of the arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest
affection. they conversed with one another through the means of an
interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and safie
sang to him the divine airs of her native country.

“the turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes
of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other
plans. he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a
christian, but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear
lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer
if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they
inhabited. he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled
to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and
secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. his plans
were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris.

“the government of france were greatly enraged at the escape of their
victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. the
plot of felix was quickly discovered, and de lacey and agatha were
thrown into prison. the news reached felix and roused him from his
dream of pleasure. his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay
in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of
her whom he loved. this idea was torture to him. he quickly arranged
with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity
for escape before felix could return to italy, safie should remain as a
boarder at a convent at leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely arabian,
he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the
law, hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding.

“he did not succeed. they remained confined for five months before the
trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune
and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.

“they found a miserable asylum in the cottage in germany, where i
discovered them. felix soon learned that the treacherous turk, for
whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on
discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,
became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted italy with
his daughter, insultingly sending felix a pittance of money to aid him,
as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.

“such were the events that preyed on the heart of felix and rendered
him, when i first saw him, the most miserable of his family. he could
have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his
virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss
of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. the
arrival of the arabian now infused new life into his soul.

“when the news reached leghorn that felix was deprived of his wealth
and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her
lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. the generous
nature of safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to
expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his
tyrannical mandate.

“a few days after, the turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told
her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at leghorn
had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the
french government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to
constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. he
intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential
servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his
property, which had not yet arrived at leghorn.

“when alone, safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it
would become her to pursue in this emergency. a residence in turkey
was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse
to it. by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she
heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where
he then resided. she hesitated some time, but at length she formed her
determination. taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a
sum of money, she quitted italy with an attendant, a native of leghorn,
but who understood the common language of turkey, and departed for
germany.

“she arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage
of de lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. safie nursed her
with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the
arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country
and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. she fell, however,
into good hands. the italian had mentioned the name of the spot for
which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in
which they had lived took care that safie should arrive in safety at
the cottage of her lover.”




chapter 15


“such was the history of my beloved cottagers. it impressed me deeply.
i learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire
their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.

“as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and
generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to
become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities
were called forth and displayed. but in giving an account of the
progress of my intellect, i must not omit a circumstance which occurred
in the beginning of the month of august of the same year.

“one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i
collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, i found on
the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and
some books. i eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. 
fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which i
had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _paradise lost_, a volume
of _plutarch’s lives_, and the _sorrows of werter_. the
possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; i now continually
studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were
employed in their ordinary occupations.

“i can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. they produced
in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me
to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. in
the _sorrows of werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting
story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon
what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that i found in it a
never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. the gentle and
domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and
feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded
well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which
were for ever alive in my own bosom. but i thought werter himself a
more divine being than i had ever beheld or imagined; his character
contained no pretension, but it sank deep. the disquisitions upon
death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. i did not
pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet i inclined towards
the opinions of the hero, whose extinction i wept, without precisely
understanding it.

“as i read, however, i applied much personally to my own feelings and
condition. i found myself similar yet at the same time strangely
unlike to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i
was a listener. i sympathised with and partly understood them, but i
was unformed in mind; i was dependent on none and related to none.
‘the path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my
annihilation. my person was hideous and my stature gigantic. what did
this mean? who was i? what was i? whence did i come? what was my
destination? these questions continually recurred, but i was unable to
solve them.

“the volume of _plutarch’s lives_ which i possessed contained the
histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. this book
had a far different effect upon me from the _sorrows of werter_. i
learned from werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but plutarch
taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my
own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. many
things i read surpassed my understanding and experience. i had a very
confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,
and boundless seas. but i was perfectly unacquainted with towns and
large assemblages of men. the cottage of my protectors had been the
only school in which i had studied human nature, but this book
developed new and mightier scenes of action. i read of men concerned
in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. i felt the
greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as
far as i understood the signification of those terms, relative as they
were, as i applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. induced by these
feelings, i was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, numa,
solon, and lycurgus, in preference to romulus and theseus. the
patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a
firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had
been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, i should
have been imbued with different sensations.

“but _paradise lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. i read
it, as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as
a true history. it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the
picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of
exciting. i often referred the several situations, as their similarity
struck me, to my own. like adam, i was apparently united by no link to
any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine
in every other respect. he had come forth from the hands of god a
perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of
his creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from
beings of a superior nature, but i was wretched, helpless, and alone.
many times i considered satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for
often, like him, when i viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter
gall of envy rose within me.

“another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. soon
after my arrival in the hovel i discovered some papers in the pocket of
the dress which i had taken from your laboratory. at first i had
neglected them, but now that i was able to decipher the characters in
which they were written, i began to study them with diligence. it was
your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. you
minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress
of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic
occurrences. you doubtless recollect these papers. here they are.
everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed
origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances
which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious
and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own
horrors and rendered mine indelible. i sickened as i read. ‘hateful
day when i received life!’ i exclaimed in agony. ‘accursed creator!
why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in
disgust? god, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the
very resemblance. satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire
and encourage him, but i am solitary and abhorred.’

“these were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;
but when i contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and
benevolent dispositions, i persuaded myself that when they should
become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would
compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. could they turn
from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion
and friendship? i resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way
to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. i
postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance
attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest i should fail.
besides, i found that my understanding improved so much with every
day’s experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking
until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.

“several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. the
presence of safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and i also
found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. felix and agatha
spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in
their labours by servants. they did not appear rich, but they were
contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while
mine became every day more tumultuous. increase of knowledge only
discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was. i
cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when i beheld my person
reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail
image and that inconstant shade.

“i endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial
which in a few months i resolved to undergo; and sometimes i allowed my
thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of paradise, and
dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my
feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed
smiles of consolation. but it was all a dream; no eve soothed my
sorrows nor shared my thoughts; i was alone. i remembered adam’s
supplication to his creator. but where was mine? he had abandoned me,
and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed him.

“autumn passed thus. i saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay
and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it
had worn when i first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. yet i did
not heed the bleakness of the weather; i was better fitted by my
conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. but my chief
delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay
apparel of summer; when those deserted me, i turned with more attention
towards the cottagers. their happiness was not decreased by the
absence of summer. they loved and sympathised with one another; and
their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the
casualties that took place around them. the more i saw of them, the
greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my
heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see
their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost
limit of my ambition. i dared not think that they would turn them from
me with disdain and horror. the poor that stopped at their door were
never driven away. i asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a
little food or rest: i required kindness and sympathy; but i did not
believe myself utterly unworthy of it.

“the winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken
place since i awoke into life. my attention at this time was solely
directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my
protectors. i revolved many projects, but that on which i finally
fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.
i had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my
person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly
beheld me. my voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; i
thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children i could gain
the good will and mediation of the old de lacey, i might by his means
be tolerated by my younger protectors.

“one day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground
and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, safie, agatha,
and felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own
desire, was left alone in the cottage. when his children had departed,
he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more
sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before. at first his
countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,
thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the
instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.

“my heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which
would decide my hopes or realise my fears. the servants were gone to a
neighbouring fair. all was silent in and around the cottage; it was an
excellent opportunity; yet, when i proceeded to execute my plan, my
limbs failed me and i sank to the ground. again i rose, and exerting
all the firmness of which i was master, removed the planks which i had
placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. the fresh air revived
me, and with renewed determination i approached the door of their
cottage.

“i knocked. ‘who is there?’ said the old man. ‘come in.’

“i entered. ‘pardon this intrusion,’ said i; ‘i am
a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you
would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’

“‘enter,’ said de lacey, ‘and i will try in what
manner i can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are
from home, and as i am blind, i am afraid i shall find it difficult to
procure food for you.’

“‘do not trouble yourself, my kind host; i have food; it is
warmth and rest only that i need.’

“i sat down, and a silence ensued. i knew that every minute was
precious to me, yet i remained irresolute in what manner to commence
the interview, when the old man addressed me.

‘by your language, stranger, i suppose you are my countryman; are you
french?’

“‘no; but i was educated by a french family and understand that
language only. i am now going to claim the protection of some friends,
whom i sincerely love, and of whose favour i have some hopes.’

“‘are they germans?’

“‘no, they are french. but let us change the subject. i am an
unfortunate and deserted creature, i look around and i have no relation
or friend upon earth. these amiable people to whom i go have never
seen me and know little of me. i am full of fears, for if i fail
there, i am an outcast in the world for ever.’

“‘do not despair. to be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but
the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are
full of brotherly love and charity. rely, therefore, on your hopes;
and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’

“‘they are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;
but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. i have good
dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree
beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they
ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable
monster.’

“‘that is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot
you undeceive them?’

“‘i am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that i
feel so many overwhelming terrors. i tenderly love these friends; i
have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily
kindness towards them; but they believe that i wish to injure them, and
it is that prejudice which i wish to overcome.’

“‘where do these friends reside?’

“‘near this spot.’

“the old man paused and then continued, ‘if you will unreservedly
confide to me the particulars of your tale, i perhaps may be of use in
undeceiving them. i am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but
there is something in your words which persuades me that you are
sincere. i am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure
to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’

“‘excellent man! i thank you and accept your generous offer. you
raise me from the dust by this kindness; and i trust that, by your aid,
i shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow
creatures.’

“‘heaven forbid! even if you were really criminal, for that can only
drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. i also am
unfortunate; i and my family have been condemned, although innocent;
judge, therefore, if i do not feel for your misfortunes.’

“‘how can i thank you, my best and only benefactor? from your lips
first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; i shall
be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success
with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting.’

“‘may i know the names and residence of those friends?’

“i paused. this, i thought, was the moment of decision, which was to
rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. i struggled vainly for
firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my
remaining strength; i sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. at that
moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors. i had not a moment
to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, i cried, ‘now is the
time! save and protect me! you and your family are the friends whom i
seek. do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’

“‘great god!’ exclaimed the old man. ‘who are you?’

“at that instant the cottage door was opened, and felix, safie, and
agatha entered. who can describe their horror and consternation on
beholding me? agatha fainted, and safie, unable to attend to her
friend, rushed out of the cottage. felix darted forward, and with
supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees i clung, in
a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently
with a stick. i could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends
the antelope. but my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and
i refrained. i saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,
overcome by pain and anguish, i quitted the cottage, and in the general
tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”




chapter 16


“cursed, cursed creator! why did i live? why, in that instant, did i
not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly
bestowed? i know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my
feelings were those of rage and revenge. i could with pleasure have
destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with
their shrieks and misery.

“when night came i quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and
now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, i gave vent to my
anguish in fearful howlings. i was like a wild beast that had broken
the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging
through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. oh! what a miserable
night i passed! the cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees
waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird
burst forth amidst the universal stillness. all, save i, were at rest
or in enjoyment; i, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and
finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread
havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed
the ruin.

“but this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; i became
fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in
the sick impotence of despair. there was none among the myriads of men
that existed who would pity or assist me; and should i feel kindness
towards my enemies? no; from that moment i declared everlasting war
against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me
and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.

“the sun rose; i heard the voices of men and knew that it was
impossible to return to my retreat during that day. accordingly i hid
myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours
to reflection on my situation.

“the pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some
degree of tranquillity; and when i considered what had passed at the
cottage, i could not help believing that i had been too hasty in my
conclusions. i had certainly acted imprudently. it was apparent that
my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and i was a
fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. i
ought to have familiarised the old de lacey to me, and by degrees to
have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have
been prepared for my approach. but i did not believe my errors to be
irretrievable, and after much consideration i resolved to return to the
cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my
party.

“these thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon i sank into a profound
sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by
peaceful dreams. the horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever
acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged felix
tearing me from his father’s feet. i awoke exhausted, and finding that
it was already night, i crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in
search of food.

“when my hunger was appeased, i directed my steps towards the
well-known path that conducted to the cottage. all there was at peace.
i crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the
accustomed hour when the family arose. that hour passed, the sun
mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. i
trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. the inside
of the cottage was dark, and i heard no motion; i cannot describe the
agony of this suspense.

“presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they
entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but i did not
understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,
which differed from that of my protectors. soon after, however, felix
approached with another man; i was surprised, as i knew that he had not
quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from
his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.

“‘do you consider,’ said his companion to him,
‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose
the produce of your garden? i do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and
i beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your
determination.’

“‘it is utterly useless,’ replied felix; ‘we can
never again inhabit your cottage. the life of my father is in the greatest
danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that i have related. my wife and
my sister will never recover from their horror. i entreat you not to reason
with me any more. take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this
place.’

“felix trembled violently as he said this. he and his companion
entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then
departed. i never saw any of the family of de lacey more.

“i continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of
utter and stupid despair. my protectors had departed and had broken
the only link that held me to the world. for the first time the
feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and i did not strive to
control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, i
bent my mind towards injury and death. when i thought of my friends,
of the mild voice of de lacey, the gentle eyes of agatha, and the
exquisite beauty of the arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of
tears somewhat soothed me. but again when i reflected that they had
spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to
injure anything human, i turned my fury towards inanimate objects. as
night advanced, i placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,
and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,
i waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my
operations.

“as the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly
dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore
along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my
spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. i lighted the
dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,
my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon
nearly touched. a part of its orb was at length hid, and i waved my
brand; it sank, and with a loud scream i fired the straw, and heath,
and bushes, which i had collected. the wind fanned the fire, and the
cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and
licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.

“as soon as i was convinced that no assistance could save any part of
the habitation, i quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.

“and now, with the world before me, whither should i bend my steps? i
resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated
and despised, every country must be equally horrible. at length the
thought of you crossed my mind. i learned from your papers that you
were my father, my creator; and to whom could i apply with more fitness
than to him who had given me life? among the lessons that felix had
bestowed upon safie, geography had not been omitted; i had learned from
these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.
you had mentioned geneva as the name of your native town, and towards
this place i resolved to proceed.

“but how was i to direct myself? i knew that i must travel in a
southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my
only guide. i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass
through, nor could i ask information from a single human being; but i
did not despair. from you only could i hope for succour, although
towards you i felt no sentiment but that of hatred. unfeeling,
heartless creator! you had endowed me with perceptions and passions
and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.
but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress, and from you i
determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from
any other being that wore the human form.

“my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense. it was
late in autumn when i quitted the district where i had so long resided.
i travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a
human being. nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;
rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface
of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and i found no shelter. oh,
earth! how often did i imprecate curses on the cause of my being! the
mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall
and bitterness. the nearer i approached to your habitation, the more
deeply did i feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. snow
fell, and the waters were hardened, but i rested not. a few incidents
now and then directed me, and i possessed a map of the country; but i
often wandered wide from my path. the agony of my feelings allowed me
no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could
not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when i arrived
on the confines of switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth
and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial
manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.

“i generally rested during the day and travelled only when i was
secured by night from the view of man. one morning, however, finding
that my path lay through a deep wood, i ventured to continue my journey
after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,
cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of
the air. i felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long
appeared dead, revive within me. half surprised by the novelty of
these sensations, i allowed myself to be borne away by them, and
forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. soft tears
again bedewed my cheeks, and i even raised my humid eyes with
thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.

“i continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until i came to its
boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many
of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.
here i paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when i heard
the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade
of a cypress. i was scarcely hid when a young girl came running
towards the spot where i was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from
someone in sport. she continued her course along the precipitous sides
of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the
rapid stream. i rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,
from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. she
was senseless, and i endeavoured by every means in my power to restore
animation, when i was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,
who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. on
seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,
hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. i followed speedily, i
hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,
which he carried, at my body and fired. i sank to the ground, and my
injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.

“this was then the reward of my benevolence! i had saved a human being
from destruction, and as a recompense i now writhed under the miserable
pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. the feelings of
kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments
before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. inflamed by
pain, i vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. but the
agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and i fainted.

“for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to
cure the wound which i had received. the ball had entered my shoulder,
and i knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any
rate i had no means of extracting it. my sufferings were augmented
also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their
infliction. my daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,
such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had
endured.

“after some weeks my wound healed, and i continued my journey. the
labours i endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or
gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my
desolate state and made me feel more painfully that i was not made for
the enjoyment of pleasure.

“but my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time i
reached the environs of geneva.

“it was evening when i arrived, and i retired to a hiding-place among
the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner i should apply
to you. i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to
enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting
behind the stupendous mountains of jura.

“at this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,
which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came
running into the recess i had chosen, with all the sportiveness of
infancy. suddenly, as i gazed on him, an idea seized me that this
little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have
imbibed a horror of deformity. if, therefore, i could seize him and
educate him as my companion and friend, i should not be so desolate in
this peopled earth.

“urged by this impulse, i seized on the boy as he passed and drew him
towards me. as soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before
his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; i drew his hand forcibly from his
face and said, ‘child, what is the meaning of this? i do not intend to
hurt you; listen to me.’

“he struggled violently. ‘let me go,’ he cried;
‘monster! ugly wretch! you wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. you
are an ogre. let me go, or i will tell my papa.’

“‘boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’

“‘hideous monster! let me go. my papa is a syndic—he is m.
frankenstein—he will punish you. you dare not keep me.’

“‘frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom i have
sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’

“the child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried
despair to my heart; i grasped his throat to silence him, and in a
moment he lay dead at my feet.

“i gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish
triumph; clapping my hands, i exclaimed, ‘i too can create desolation;
my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and
a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’

“as i fixed my eyes on the child, i saw something glittering on his
breast. i took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. in spite
of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. for a few moments i
gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her
lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; i remembered that i was
for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could
bestow and that she whose resemblance i contemplated would, in
regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one
expressive of disgust and affright.

“can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? i only
wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in
exclamations and agony, i did not rush among mankind and perish in the
attempt to destroy them.

“while i was overcome by these feelings, i left the spot where i had
committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, i
entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. a woman was
sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her
whose portrait i held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the
loveliness of youth and health. here, i thought, is one of those whose
joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. and then i bent over
her and whispered, ‘awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would
give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my
beloved, awake!’

“the sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. should she
indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? thus
would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.
the thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not i, but
she, shall suffer; the murder i have committed because i am for ever
robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. the crime had
its source in her; be hers the punishment! thanks to the lessons of
felix and the sanguinary laws of man, i had learned now to work
mischief. i bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of
the folds of her dress. she moved again, and i fled.

“for some days i haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,
sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and
its miseries for ever. at length i wandered towards these mountains,
and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning
passion which you alone can gratify. we may not part until you have
promised to comply with my requisition. i am alone and miserable; man
will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself
would not deny herself to me. my companion must be of the same species
and have the same defects. this being you must create.”




chapter 17


the being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the
expectation of a reply. but i was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to
arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his
proposition. he continued,

“you must create a female for me with whom i can live in the
interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. this you alone
can do, and i demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to
concede.”

the latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had
died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and
as he said this i could no longer suppress the rage that burned within
me.

“i do refuse it,” i replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a
consent from me. you may render me the most miserable of men, but you
shall never make me base in my own eyes. shall i create another like
yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. begone! i
have answered you; you may torture me, but i will never consent.”

“you are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead
of threatening, i am content to reason with you. i am malicious because i
am miserable. am i not shunned and hated by all mankind? you, my creator,
would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why i
should pity man more than he pities me? you would not call it murder if you
could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the
work of your own hands. shall i respect man when he condemns me? let him
live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury i would
bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.
but that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our
union. yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. i will
revenge my injuries; if i cannot inspire love, i will cause fear, and
chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do i swear
inextinguishable hatred. have a care; i will work at your destruction, nor
finish until i desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of
your birth.”

a fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled
into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently
he calmed himself and proceeded—

“i intended to reason. this passion is detrimental to me, for you do
not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. if any being felt
emotions of benevolence towards me, i should return them a hundred and a
hundredfold; for that one creature’s sake i would make peace with the
whole kind! but i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.
what i ask of you is reasonable and moderate; i demand a creature of
another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it
is all that i can receive, and it shall content me. it is true, we shall be
monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more
attached to one another. our lives will not be happy, but they will be
harmless and free from the misery i now feel. oh! my creator, make me
happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! let me see that i
excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my
request!”

i was moved. i shuddered when i thought of the possible consequences
of my consent, but i felt that there was some justice in his argument.
his tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature
of fine sensations, and did i not as his maker owe him all the portion
of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? he saw my change of
feeling and continued,

“if you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see
us again; i will go to the vast wilds of south america. my food is not
that of man; i do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;
acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. my companion will
be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.
we shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on
man and will ripen our food. the picture i present to you is peaceful
and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the
wantonness of power and cruelty. pitiless as you have been towards me,
i now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment
and persuade you to promise what i so ardently desire.”

“you propose,” replied i, “to fly from the habitations of
man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your
only companions. how can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,
persevere in this exile? you will return and again seek their kindness, and
you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,
and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.
this may not be; cease to argue the point, for i cannot consent.”

“how inconstant are your feelings! but a moment ago you were moved by
my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?
i swear to you, by the earth which i inhabit, and by you that made me, that
with the companion you bestow, i will quit the neighbourhood of man and
dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. my evil passions
will have fled, for i shall meet with sympathy! my life will flow quietly
away, and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker.”

his words had a strange effect upon me. i compassionated him and
sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when i looked upon him, when
i saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my
feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. i tried to stifle
these sensations; i thought that as i could not sympathise with him, i
had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which
was yet in my power to bestow.

“you swear,” i said, “to be harmless; but have you not
already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust
you? may not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by
affording a wider scope for your revenge?”

“how is this? i must not be trifled with, and i demand an answer. if
i have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;
the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and i shall
become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. my vices
are the children of a forced solitude that i abhor, and my virtues will
necessarily arise when i live in communion with an equal. i shall feel
the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of
existence and events from which i am now excluded.”

i paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various
arguments which he had employed. i thought of the promise of virtues which
he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight
of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had
manifested towards him. his power and threats were not omitted in my
calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers
and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices
was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. after a
long pause of reflection i concluded that the justice due both to him and
my fellow creatures demanded of me that i should comply with his request.
turning to him, therefore, i said,

“i consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit europe for ever,
and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as i shall
deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”

“i swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of
heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my
prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. depart to your
home and commence your labours; i shall watch their progress with
unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready i shall
appear.”

saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in
my sentiments. i saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than
the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the
sea of ice.

his tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of
the horizon when he departed. i knew that i ought to hasten my descent
towards the valley, as i should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my
heart was heavy, and my steps slow. the labour of winding among the
little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced
perplexed me, occupied as i was by the emotions which the occurrences
of the day had produced. night was far advanced when i came to the
halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. the stars
shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines
rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the
ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange
thoughts within me. i wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, i
exclaimed, “oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock
me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as
nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”

these were wild and miserable thoughts, but i cannot describe to you
how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how i
listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its
way to consume me.

morning dawned before i arrived at the village of chamounix; i took no
rest, but returned immediately to geneva. even in my own heart i could
give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a
mountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.
thus i returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the
family. my haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but i
answered no question, scarcely did i speak. i felt as if i were placed
under a ban—as if i had no right to claim their sympathies—as if
never more might i enjoy companionship with them. yet even thus i
loved them to adoration; and to save them, i resolved to dedicate
myself to my most abhorred task. the prospect of such an occupation
made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,
and that thought only had to me the reality of life.




chapter 18


day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to geneva; and
i could not collect the courage to recommence my work. i feared the
vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet i was unable to overcome my
repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. i found that i could not
compose a female without again devoting several months to profound
study and laborious disquisition. i had heard of some discoveries
having been made by an english philosopher, the knowledge of which was
material to my success, and i sometimes thought of obtaining my
father’s consent to visit england for this purpose; but i clung to
every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an
undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to
me. a change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had
hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. my
father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts
towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,
which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring
blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. at these moments i took
refuge in the most perfect solitude. i passed whole days on the lake
alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the
rippling of the waves, silent and listless. but the fresh air and
bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and
on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
and a more cheerful heart.

it was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,
calling me aside, thus addressed me,

“i am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former
pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. and yet you are still
unhappy and still avoid our society. for some time i was lost in
conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,
and if it is well founded, i conjure you to avow it. reserve on such a
point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”

i trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—

“i confess, my son, that i have always looked forward to your
marriage with our dear elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the
stay of my declining years. you were attached to each other from your
earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and
tastes, entirely suited to one another. but so blind is the experience of
man that what i conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have
entirely destroyed it. you, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any
wish that she might become your wife. nay, you may have met with another
whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to
elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear
to feel.”

“my dear father, reassure yourself. i love my cousin tenderly and
sincerely. i never saw any woman who excited, as elizabeth does, my
warmest admiration and affection. my future hopes and prospects are
entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”

“the expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear victor,
gives me more pleasure than i have for some time experienced. if you
feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast
a gloom over us. but it is this gloom which appears to have taken so
strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissipate. tell me,
therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the
marriage. we have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us
from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. you
are younger; yet i do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent
fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future
plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. do not suppose,
however, that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on
your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. interpret my words
with candour and answer me, i conjure you, with confidence and
sincerity.”

i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable
of offering any reply. i revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of
thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. alas! to me
the idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth was one of horror and
dismay. i was bound by a solemn promise which i had not yet fulfilled
and dared not break, or if i did, what manifold miseries might not
impend over me and my devoted family! could i enter into a festival
with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the
ground? i must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with
his mate before i allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from
which i expected peace.

i remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
england or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers
of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable
use to me in my present undertaking. the latter method of obtaining
the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, i
had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my
loathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar
intercourse with those i loved. i knew that a thousand fearful
accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to
thrill all connected with me with horror. i was aware also that i
should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the
harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my
unearthly occupation. i must absent myself from all i loved while thus
employed. once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and i might be
restored to my family in peace and happiness. my promise fulfilled,
the monster would depart for ever. or (so my fond fancy imaged) some
accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my
slavery for ever.

these feelings dictated my answer to my father. i expressed a wish to
visit england, but concealing the true reasons of this request, i
clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while i
urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to
comply. after so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that
resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find
that i was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,
and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my
return, have restored me entirely to myself.

the duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or
at most a year, was the period contemplated. one paternal kind
precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. without
previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with elizabeth,
arranged that clerval should join me at strasburgh. this interfered
with the solitude i coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the
commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be
an impediment, and truly i rejoiced that thus i should be saved many
hours of lonely, maddening reflection. nay, henry might stand between
me and the intrusion of my foe. if i were alone, would he not at times
force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to
contemplate its progress?

to england, therefore, i was bound, and it was understood that my union
with elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. my father’s
age rendered him extremely averse to delay. for myself, there was one
reward i promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my
unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,
enfranchised from my miserable slavery, i might claim elizabeth and
forget the past in my union with her.

i now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me
which filled me with fear and agitation. during my absence i should
leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and
unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my
departure. but he had promised to follow me wherever i might go, and
would he not accompany me to england? this imagination was dreadful in
itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.
i was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of
this might happen. but through the whole period during which i was the
slave of my creature i allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of
the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend
would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his
machinations.

it was in the latter end of september that i again quitted my native
country. my journey had been my own suggestion, and elizabeth
therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of
my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. it had
been her care which provided me a companion in clerval—and yet a man
is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s
sedulous attention. she longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand
conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent
farewell.

i threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly
knowing whither i was going, and careless of what was passing around.
i remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that i reflected on
it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with
me. filled with dreary imaginations, i passed through many beautiful
and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. i could
only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy
me whilst they endured.

after some days spent in listless indolence, during which i traversed
many leagues, i arrived at strasburgh, where i waited two days for
clerval. he came. alas, how great was the contrast between us! he
was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the
setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new
day. he pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and
the appearances of the sky. “this is what it is to live,” he cried;
“now i enjoy existence! but you, my dear frankenstein, wherefore are
you desponding and sorrowful!” in truth, i was occupied by gloomy
thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden
sunrise reflected in the rhine. and you, my friend, would be far more
amused with the journal of clerval, who observed the scenery with an
eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. i, a
miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to
enjoyment.

we had agreed to descend the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to
rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for london. during this
voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.
we stayed a day at mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from
strasburgh, arrived at mainz. the course of the rhine below mainz
becomes much more picturesque. the river descends rapidly and winds
between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. we saw
many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
black woods, high and inaccessible. this part of the rhine, indeed,
presents a singularly variegated landscape. in one spot you view
rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with
the dark rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,
flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river
and populous towns occupy the scene.

we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers
as we glided down the stream. even i, depressed in mind, and my spirits
continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even i was pleased. i lay at the
bottom of the boat, and as i gazed on the cloudless blue sky, i seemed to
drink in a tranquillity to which i had long been a stranger. and if these
were my sensations, who can describe those of henry? he felt as if he had
been transported to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by
man. “i have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes
of my own country; i have visited the lakes of lucerne and uri, where the
snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black
and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance
were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay
appearance; i have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore
up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be
on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,
where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and
where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the
nightly wind; i have seen the mountains of la valais, and the pays de vaud;
but this country, victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. the
mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a
charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalled.
look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the
island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now
that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village
half hid in the recess of the mountain. oh, surely the spirit that inhabits
and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who
pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of
our own country.”

clerval! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record your words and
to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. he was a
being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” his wild and
enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. his
soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that
devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only
in the imagination. but even human sympathies were not sufficient to
satisfy his eager mind. the scenery of external nature, which others regard
only with admiration, he loved with ardour:—

    ——the sounding cataract
    haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,
    the mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
    their colours and their forms, were then to him
    an appetite; a feeling, and a love,
    that had no need of a remoter charm,
    by thought supplied, or any interest
    unborrow’d from the eye.

          [wordsworth’s “tintern abbey”.]

and where does he now exist? is this gentle and lovely being lost
for ever? has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful
and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the
life of its creator;—has this mind perished? does it now only exist
in my memory? no, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and
consoles your unhappy friend.

pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight
tribute to the unexampled worth of henry, but they soothe my heart,
overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. i will
proceed with my tale.

beyond cologne we descended to the plains of holland; and we resolved to
post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of
the river was too gentle to aid us.

our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we
arrived in a few days at rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to england.
it was on a clear morning, in the latter days of december, that i first saw
the white cliffs of britain. the banks of the thames presented a new scene;
they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the
remembrance of some story. we saw tilbury fort and remembered the spanish
armada, gravesend, woolwich, and greenwich—places which i had heard
of even in my country.

at length we saw the numerous steeples of london, st. paul’s towering
above all, and the tower famed in english history.




chapter 19


london was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several
months in this wonderful and celebrated city. clerval desired the
intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this
time, but this was with me a secondary object; i was principally
occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the
completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of
introduction that i had brought with me, addressed to the most
distinguished natural philosophers.

if this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,
it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. but a blight had
come over my existence, and i only visited these people for the sake of
the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest
was so terribly profound. company was irksome to me; when alone, i
could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of
henry soothed me, and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory
peace. but busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to
my heart. i saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my
fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of william and
justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled
my soul with anguish.

but in clerval i saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive
and anxious to gain experience and instruction. the difference of
manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of
instruction and amusement. he was also pursuing an object he had long
had in view. his design was to visit india, in the belief that he had
in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had
taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of
european colonization and trade. in britain only could he further the
execution of his plan. he was for ever busy, and the only check to his
enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. i tried to conceal this
as much as possible, that i might not debar him from the pleasures
natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by
any care or bitter recollection. i often refused to accompany him,
alleging another engagement, that i might remain alone. i now also
began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this
was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling
on the head. every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme
anguish, and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips
to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.

after passing some months in london, we received a letter from a person in
scotland who had formerly been our visitor at geneva. he mentioned the
beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient
allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth,
where he resided. clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and i,
although i abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and
all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.

we had arrived in england at the beginning of october, and it was now
february. we accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the
north at the expiration of another month. in this expedition we did not
intend to follow the great road to edinburgh, but to visit windsor, oxford,
matlock, and the cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of
this tour about the end of july. i packed up my chemical instruments and
the materials i had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some
obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland.

we quitted london on the 27th of march and remained a few days at
windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. this was a new scene to us
mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of
stately deer were all novelties to us.

from thence we proceeded to oxford. as we entered this city, our minds
were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted
there more than a century and a half before. it was here that charles
i. had collected his forces. this city had remained faithful to him,
after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of
parliament and liberty. the memory of that unfortunate king and his
companions, the amiable falkland, the insolent goring, his queen, and
son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they
might be supposed to have inhabited. the spirit of elder days found a
dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. if these
feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of
the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.
the colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
magnificent; and the lovely isis, which flows beside it through meadows
of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,
which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and
domes, embosomed among aged trees.

i enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the
memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. i was formed
for peaceful happiness. during my youthful days discontent never
visited my mind, and if i was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what
is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in
the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate
elasticity to my spirits. but i am a blasted tree; the bolt has
entered my soul; and i felt then that i should survive to exhibit what
i shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,
pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.

we passed a considerable period at oxford, rambling among its environs
and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most
animating epoch of english history. our little voyages of discovery
were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented
themselves. we visited the tomb of the illustrious hampden and the
field on which that patriot fell. for a moment my soul was elevated
from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas
of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments
and the remembrancers. for an instant i dared to shake off my chains
and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten
into my flesh, and i sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my
miserable self.

we left oxford with regret and proceeded to matlock, which was our next
place of rest. the country in the neighbourhood of this village
resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of switzerland; but
everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of
distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my
native country. we visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets
of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same
manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix. the latter name
made me tremble when pronounced by henry, and i hastened to quit
matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.

from derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in
cumberland and westmorland. i could now almost fancy myself among the
swiss mountains. the little patches of snow which yet lingered on the
northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the
rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. here also we
made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into
happiness. the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than
mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found
in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have
imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his
inferiors. “i could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among
these mountains i should scarcely regret switzerland and the rhine.”

but he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain
amidst its enjoyments. his feelings are for ever on the stretch; and
when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit
that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again
engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.

we had scarcely visited the various lakes of cumberland and westmorland
and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period
of our appointment with our scotch friend approached, and we left them
to travel on. for my own part i was not sorry. i had now neglected my
promise for some time, and i feared the effects of the dæmon’s
disappointment. he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance
on my relatives. this idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment
from which i might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. i waited
for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed i was
miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and i
saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father, i hardly dared to
read and ascertain my fate. sometimes i thought that the fiend
followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
when these thoughts possessed me, i would not quit henry for a moment,
but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of
his destroyer. i felt as if i had committed some great crime, the
consciousness of which haunted me. i was guiltless, but i had indeed
drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.

i visited edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might
have interested the most unfortunate being. clerval did not like it so well
as oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.
but the beauty and regularity of the new town of edinburgh, its romantic
castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, arthur’s
seat, st. bernard’s well, and the pentland hills, compensated him for
the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. but i was
impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.

we left edinburgh in a week, passing through coupar, st. andrew’s, and
along the banks of the tay, to perth, where our friend expected us.
but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into
their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and
accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland
alone. “do you,” said i, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our
rendezvous. i may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with
my motions, i entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short
time; and when i return, i hope it will be with a lighter heart, more
congenial to your own temper.”

henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to
remonstrate. he entreated me to write often. “i had rather be with
you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these scotch
people, whom i do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,
that i may again feel myself somewhat at home, which i cannot do in
your absence.”

having parted from my friend, i determined to visit some remote spot of
scotland and finish my work in solitude. i did not doubt but that the
monster followed me and would discover himself to me when i should have
finished, that he might receive his companion.

with this resolution i traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of
the remotest of the orkneys as the scene of my labours. it was a place
fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were
continually beaten upon by the waves. the soil was barren, scarcely
affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its
inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs
gave tokens of their miserable fare. vegetables and bread, when they
indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from
the mainland, which was about five miles distant.

on the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of
these was vacant when i arrived. this i hired. it contained but two
rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable
penury. the thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the
door was off its hinges. i ordered it to be repaired, bought some
furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have
occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been
benumbed by want and squalid poverty. as it was, i lived ungazed at
and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes
which i gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations
of men.

in this retreat i devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,
when the weather permitted, i walked on the stony beach of the sea to
listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. it was a
monotonous yet ever-changing scene. i thought of switzerland; it was
far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. its hills
are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the
plains. its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when
troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively
infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.

in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived, but
as i proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and
irksome to me. sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my
laboratory for several days, and at other times i toiled day and night
in order to complete my work. it was, indeed, a filthy process in
which i was engaged. during my first experiment, a kind of
enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my
mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes
were shut to the horror of my proceedings. but now i went to it in
cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.

thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in
a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from
the actual scene in which i was engaged, my spirits became unequal; i
grew restless and nervous. every moment i feared to meet my
persecutor. sometimes i sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing
to raise them lest they should encounter the object which i so much
dreaded to behold. i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow
creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.

in the mean time i worked on, and my labour was already considerably
advanced. i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager
hope, which i dared not trust myself to question but which was
intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken
in my bosom.




chapter 20


i sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just
rising from the sea; i had not sufficient light for my employment, and i
remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my
labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention
to it. as i sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to
consider the effects of what i was now doing. three years before, i was
engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled
barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest
remorse. i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i was
alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her
mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. he had
sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she
had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and
reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her
creation. they might even hate each other; the creature who already lived
loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence
for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? she also might turn
with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,
and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being
deserted by one of his own species.

even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,
yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon
thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon
the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a
condition precarious and full of terror. had i right, for my own benefit,
to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? i had before been moved
by the sophisms of the being i had created; i had been struck senseless by
his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my
promise burst upon me; i shuddered to think that future ages might curse me
as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at
the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.

i trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, i saw by
the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. a ghastly grin
wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where i sat fulfilling the task
which he had allotted to me. yes, he had followed me in my travels; he
had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide
and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the
fulfilment of my promise.

as i looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of
malice and treachery. i thought with a sensation of madness on my
promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,
tore to pieces the thing on which i was engaged. the wretch saw me
destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for
happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.

i left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own
heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, i
sought my own apartment. i was alone; none were near me to dissipate
the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most
terrible reveries.

several hours passed, and i remained near my window gazing on the sea;
it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature
reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. a few fishing vessels alone
specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound
of voices as the fishermen called to one another. i felt the silence,
although i was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear
was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a
person landed close to my house.

in a few minutes after, i heard the creaking of my door, as if some one
endeavoured to open it softly. i trembled from head to foot; i felt a
presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who
dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but i was overcome by the sensation
of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain
endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.

presently i heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door
opened, and the wretch whom i dreaded appeared. shutting the door, he
approached me and said in a smothered voice,

“you have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you
intend? do you dare to break your promise? i have endured toil and misery;
i left switzerland with you; i crept along the shores of the rhine, among
its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. i have dwelt many
months in the heaths of england and among the deserts of scotland. i have
endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my
hopes?”

“begone! i do break my promise; never will i create another like
yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”

“slave, i before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself
unworthy of my condescension. remember that i have power; you believe
yourself miserable, but i can make you so wretched that the light of
day will be hateful to you. you are my creator, but i am your master;
obey!”

“the hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is
arrived. your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but
they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in
vice. shall i, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose
delight is in death and wretchedness? begone! i am firm, and your
words will only exasperate my rage.”

the monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the
impotence of anger. “shall each man,” cried he, “find a
wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and i be alone? i had
feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.
man! you may hate, but beware! your hours will pass in dread and misery,
and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for
ever. are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my
wretchedness? you can blast my other passions, but revenge
remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! i may die, but
first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your
misery. beware, for i am fearless and therefore powerful. i will watch with
the wiliness of a snake, that i may sting with its venom. man, you shall
repent of the injuries you inflict.”

“devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.
i have declared my resolution to you, and i am no coward to bend
beneath words. leave me; i am inexorable.”

“it is well. i go; but remember, i shall be with you on your
wedding-night.”

i started forward and exclaimed, “villain! before you sign my
death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”

i would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with
precipitation. in a few moments i saw him in his boat, which shot
across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the
waves.

all was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. i burned with rage to
pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. i
walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination
conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. why had i not
followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? but i had suffered him
to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. i shuddered
to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.
and then i thought again of his words—“_i will be with you on
your wedding-night._” that, then, was the period fixed for the
fulfilment of my destiny. in that hour i should die and at once satisfy and
extinguish his malice. the prospect did not move me to fear; yet when i
thought of my beloved elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she
should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first i
had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and i resolved not to fall
before my enemy without a bitter struggle.

the night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became
calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into
the depths of despair. i left the house, the horrid scene of the last
night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which i
almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow
creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. i
desired that i might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,
but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. if i returned, it was to
be sacrificed or to see those whom i most loved die under the grasp of a
dæmon whom i had myself created.

i walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it
loved and miserable in the separation. when it became noon, and the
sun rose higher, i lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep
sleep. i had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves
were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. the sleep
into which i now sank refreshed me; and when i awoke, i again felt as
if i belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and i began to
reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the
words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared
like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.

the sun had far descended, and i still sat on the shore, satisfying my
appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when i saw a
fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;
it contained letters from geneva, and one from clerval entreating me to
join him. he said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where
he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in london desired
his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his
indian enterprise. he could not any longer delay his departure; but as
his journey to london might be followed, even sooner than he now
conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of
my society on him as i could spare. he besought me, therefore, to
leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth, that we might proceed
southwards together. this letter in a degree recalled me to life, and
i determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.

yet, before i departed, there was a task to perform, on which i shuddered
to reflect; i must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose i
must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and i must
handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. the next
morning, at daybreak, i summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door
of my laboratory. the remains of the half-finished creature, whom i had
destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and i almost felt as if i had
mangled the living flesh of a human being. i paused to collect myself and
then entered the chamber. with trembling hand i conveyed the instruments
out of the room, but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics of my
work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and i accordingly
put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them
up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the
meantime i sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my
chemical apparatus.

nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place
in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. i had
before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with
whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but i now felt as if a film
had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw
clearly. the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur
to me; the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts, but i did not
reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. i had resolved in
my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made
would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and i
banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different
conclusion.

between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and i then, putting my
basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.
the scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,
but i sailed away from them. i felt as if i was about the commission of a
dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my
fellow creatures. at one time the moon, which had before been clear, was
suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and i took advantage of the moment of
darkness and cast my basket into the sea; i listened to the gurgling sound
as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. the sky became clouded, but
the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then
rising. but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations
that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a
direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. clouds hid the
moon, everything was obscure, and i heard only the sound of the boat as its
keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time i
slept soundly.

i do not know how long i remained in this situation, but when i awoke i
found that the sun had already mounted considerably. the wind was high, and
the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. i found
that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from
which i had embarked. i endeavoured to change my course but quickly found
that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with
water. thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. i
confess that i felt a few sensations of terror. i had no compass with me
and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the
world that the sun was of little benefit to me. i might be driven into the
wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in
the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. i had already
been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to
my other sufferings. i looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds
that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; i looked upon the
sea; it was to be my grave. “fiend,” i exclaimed, “your
task is already fulfilled!” i thought of elizabeth, of my father, and
of clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his
sanguinary and merciless passions. this idea plunged me into a reverie so
despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of
closing before me for ever, i shudder to reflect on it.

some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the
horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became
free from breakers. but these gave place to a heavy swell; i felt sick
and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly i saw a line of high
land towards the south.

almost spent, as i was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured
for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of
warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.

how mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have
of life even in the excess of misery! i constructed another sail with a
part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. it had a
wild and rocky appearance, but as i approached nearer i easily perceived
the traces of cultivation. i saw vessels near the shore and found myself
suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. i
carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at
length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. as i was in a state of
extreme debility, i resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place
where i could most easily procure nourishment. fortunately i had money with
me. as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good
harbour, which i entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected
escape.

as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several
people crowded towards the spot. they seemed much surprised at my
appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered
together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me
a slight sensation of alarm. as it was, i merely remarked that they
spoke english, and i therefore addressed them in that language. “my
good friends,” said i, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of
this town and inform me where i am?”

“you will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.
“maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,
but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, i promise you.”

i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a
stranger, and i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and
angry countenances of his companions. “why do you answer me so
roughly?” i replied. “surely it is not the custom of englishmen to
receive strangers so inhospitably.”

“i do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the
english may be, but it is the custom of the irish to hate villains.”

while this strange dialogue continued, i perceived the crowd rapidly
increase. their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which
annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. i inquired the way to the inn, but
no one replied. i then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the
crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man
approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “come, sir, you must
follow me to mr. kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”

“who is mr. kirwin? why am i to give an account of myself? is not
this a free country?”

“ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. mr. kirwin is a magistrate,
and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was
found murdered here last night.”

this answer startled me, but i presently recovered myself. i was innocent;
that could easily be proved; accordingly i followed my conductor in silence
and was led to one of the best houses in the town. i was ready to sink from
fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, i thought it politic
to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into
apprehension or conscious guilt. little did i then expect the calamity that
was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair
all fear of ignominy or death.

i must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of
the frightful events which i am about to relate, in proper detail, to my
recollection.




chapter 21


i was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old
benevolent man with calm and mild manners. he looked upon me, however,
with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,
he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.

about half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the
magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with
his son and brother-in-law, daniel nugent, when, about ten o’clock,
they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in
for port. it was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did
not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about
two miles below. he walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,
and his companions followed him at some distance. as he was proceeding
along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his
length on the ground. his companions came up to assist him, and by the
light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,
who was to all appearance dead. their first supposition was that it was the
corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the
waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even
that the body was not then cold. they instantly carried it to the cottage
of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it
to life. it appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty
years of age. he had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of
any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.

the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but
when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of
my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a
mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for
support. the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew
an unfavourable augury from my manner.

the son confirmed his father’s account, but when daniel nugent was
called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he
saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;
and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same
boat in which i had just landed.

a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door
of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour
before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with
only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse
was afterwards found.

another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the
body into her house; it was not cold. they put it into a bed and
rubbed it, and daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was
quite gone.

several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed
that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it
was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been
obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed.
besides, they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body
from another place, and it was likely that as i did not appear to know
the shore, i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance
of the town of —— from the place where i had deposited the corpse.

mr. kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that i should be taken into
the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what
effect the sight of it would produce upon me. this idea was probably
suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the
murder had been described. i was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate
and several other persons, to the inn. i could not help being struck by the
strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,
knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i had
inhabited about the time that the body had been found, i was perfectly
tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.

i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. how
can i describe my sensations on beholding it? i feel yet parched with
horror, nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and
agony. the examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,
passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry
clerval stretched before me. i gasped for breath, and throwing myself on
the body, i exclaimed, “have my murderous machinations deprived you
also, my dearest henry, of life? two i have already destroyed; other
victims await their destiny; but you, clerval, my friend, my
benefactor—”

the human frame could no longer support the agonies that i endured, and
i was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.

a fever succeeded to this. i lay for two months on the point of death; my
ravings, as i afterwards heard, were frightful; i called myself the
murderer of william, of justine, and of clerval. sometimes i entreated my
attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was
tormented; and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already grasping
my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. fortunately, as i spoke
my native language, mr. kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and
bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.

why did i not die? more miserable than man ever was before, why did i not
sink into forgetfulness and rest? death snatches away many blooming
children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and
youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the
next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! of what materials was i
made that i could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of
the wheel, continually renewed the torture?

but i was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from
a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by
gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.
it was morning, i remember, when i thus awoke to understanding; i had
forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some
great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when i looked around
and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i
was, all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly.

this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside
me. she was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her
countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise
that class. the lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of
persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. her
tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in english,
and the voice struck me as one that i had heard during my sufferings.

“are you better now, sir?” said she.

i replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “i believe i am;
but if it be all true, if indeed i did not dream, i am sorry that i am
still alive to feel this misery and horror.”

“for that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the
gentleman you murdered, i believe that it were better for you if you
were dead, for i fancy it will go hard with you! however, that’s none
of my business; i am sent to nurse you and get you well; i do my duty
with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”

i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a
speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but i felt
languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. the whole series
of my life appeared to me as a dream; i sometimes doubted if indeed it
were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force
of reality.

as the images that floated before me became more distinct, i grew
feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed
me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. the
physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared
them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the
expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the
second. who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the
hangman who would gain his fee?

these were my first reflections, but i soon learned that mr. kirwin had
shown me extreme kindness. he had caused the best room in the prison
to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who
had provided a physician and a nurse. it is true, he seldom came to
see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of
every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and
miserable ravings of a murderer. he came, therefore, sometimes to see
that i was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long
intervals.

one day, while i was gradually recovering, i was seated in a chair, my eyes
half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. i was overcome by gloom
and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to
remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. at one time i
considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the
penalty of the law, less innocent than poor justine had been. such were my
thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and mr. kirwin entered.
his countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to
mine and addressed me in french,

“i fear that this place is very shocking to you; can i do anything to
make you more comfortable?”

“i thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole
earth there is no comfort which i am capable of receiving.”

“i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to
one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. but you will, i
hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can
easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”

“that is my least concern; i am, by a course of strange events, become
the most miserable of mortals. persecuted and tortured as i am and
have been, can death be any evil to me?”

“nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the
strange chances that have lately occurred. you were thrown, by some
surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,
seized immediately, and charged with murder. the first sight that was
presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so
unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across
your path.”

as mr. kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation i endured on
this retrospect of my sufferings, i also felt considerable surprise at
the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. i suppose some
astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for mr. kirwin hastened
to say,

“immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on
your person were brought me, and i examined them that i might discover some
trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune
and illness. i found several letters, and, among others, one which i
discovered from its commencement to be from your father. i instantly wrote
to geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.
but you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any
kind.”

“this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;
tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder i am
now to lament?”

“your family is perfectly well,” said mr. kirwin with
gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”

i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it
instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my
misery and taunt me with the death of clerval, as a new incitement for
me to comply with his hellish desires. i put my hand before my eyes,
and cried out in agony,

“oh! take him away! i cannot see him; for god’s sake, do not
let him enter!”

mr. kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. he could not help
regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in
rather a severe tone,

“i should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father
would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”

“my father!” cried i, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed
from anguish to pleasure. “is my father indeed come? how kind, how
very kind! but where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”

my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he
thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,
and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. he rose and
quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.

nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the
arrival of my father. i stretched out my hand to him and cried,

“are you then safe—and elizabeth—and ernest?”

my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by
dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my
desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of
cheerfulness. “what a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”
said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance
of the room. “you travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems
to pursue you. and poor clerval—”

the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too
great to be endured in my weak state; i shed tears.

“alas! yes, my father,” replied i; “some destiny of the
most horrible kind hangs over me, and i must live to fulfil it, or surely i
should have died on the coffin of henry.”

we were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the
precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that
could ensure tranquillity. mr. kirwin came in and insisted that my
strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. but the
appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and i
gradually recovered my health.

as my sickness quitted me, i was absorbed by a gloomy and black
melancholy that nothing could dissipate. the image of clerval was
for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. more than once the agitation
into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous
relapse. alas! why did they preserve so miserable and detested a
life? it was surely that i might fulfil my destiny, which is now
drawing to a close. soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these
throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears
me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, i shall also
sink to rest. then the appearance of death was distant, although the
wish was ever present to my thoughts; and i often sat for hours
motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that
might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.

the season of the assizes approached. i had already been three months
in prison, and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a
relapse, i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country
town where the court was held. mr. kirwin charged himself with every
care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. i was spared
the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not
brought before the court that decides on life and death. the grand
jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that i was on the orkney
islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight
after my removal i was liberated from prison.

my father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a
criminal charge, that i was again allowed to breathe the fresh
atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. i did not
participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a
palace were alike hateful. the cup of life was poisoned for ever, and
although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, i
saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by
no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. sometimes
they were the expressive eyes of henry, languishing in death, the dark
orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed
them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as i
first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt.

my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. he talked
of geneva, which i should soon visit, of elizabeth and ernest; but
these words only drew deep groans from me. sometimes, indeed, i felt a
wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved
cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more
the blue lake and rapid rhone, that had been so dear to me in early
childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a
prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and
these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and
despair. at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the
existence i loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance
to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.

yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally
triumphed over my selfish despair. it was necessary that i should
return without delay to geneva, there to watch over the lives of those
i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any
chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to
blast me by his presence, i might, with unfailing aim, put an end to
the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the
mockery of a soul still more monstrous. my father still desired to
delay our departure, fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a
journey, for i was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. my
strength was gone. i was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day
preyed upon my wasted frame.

still, as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatience,
my father thought it best to yield. we took our passage on board a vessel
bound for havre-de-grace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish shores.
it was midnight. i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to
the dashing of the waves. i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my
sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should
soon see geneva. the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;
yet the vessel in which i was, the wind that blew me from the detested
shore of ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
that i was deceived by no vision and that clerval, my friend and dearest
companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. i
repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing
with my family in geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for
ingolstadt. i remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on
to the creation of my hideous enemy, and i called to mind the night in
which he first lived. i was unable to pursue the train of thought; a
thousand feelings pressed upon me, and i wept bitterly.

ever since my recovery from the fever, i had been in the custom of taking
every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug
only that i was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of
life. oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, i now
swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. but sleep did
not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a
thousand objects that scared me. towards morning i was possessed by a kind
of nightmare; i felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free
myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. my father, who was
watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves
were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of
security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour
and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm
forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly
susceptible.




chapter 22


the voyage came to an end. we landed, and proceeded to paris. i soon
found that i had overtaxed my strength and that i must repose before i
could continue my journey. my father’s care and attentions were
indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and
sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. he wished me to
seek amusement in society. i abhorred the face of man. oh, not
abhorred! they were my brethren, my fellow beings, and i felt
attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an
angelic nature and celestial mechanism. but i felt that i had no right
to share their intercourse. i had unchained an enemy among them whose
joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. how they
would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know
my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!

my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by
various arguments to banish my despair. sometimes he thought that i
felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of
murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.

“alas! my father,” said i, “how little do you know me. 
human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such
a wretch as i felt pride. justine, poor unhappy justine, was as innocent
as i, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and i am the cause
of this—i murdered her. william, justine, and henry—they all
died by my hands.”

my father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same
assertion; when i thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an
explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of
delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented
itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which i preserved in my
convalescence. i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence
concerning the wretch i had created. i had a persuasion that i should be
supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. but,
besides, i could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my
hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of
his breast. i checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was
silent when i would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.
yet, still, words like those i have recorded would burst uncontrollably
from me. i could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part
relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.

upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,
“my dearest victor, what infatuation is this? my dear son, i entreat
you never to make such an assertion again.”

“i am not mad,” i cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who
have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. i am the
assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.
a thousand times would i have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have
saved their lives; but i could not, my father, indeed i could not
sacrifice the whole human race.”

the conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were
deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and
endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. he wished as much as
possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in
ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my
misfortunes.

as time passed away i became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my
heart, but i no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own
crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. by the utmost
self-violence i curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which
sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners
were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey
to the sea of ice.

a few days before we left paris on our way to switzerland, i received the
following letter from elizabeth:

“my dear friend,

“it gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle
dated at paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and i may
hope to see you in less than a fortnight. my poor cousin, how much you
must have suffered! i expect to see you looking even more ill than
when you quitted geneva. this winter has been passed most miserably,
tortured as i have been by anxious suspense; yet i hope to see peace in
your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of
comfort and tranquillity.

“yet i fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable
a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. i would not disturb you at
this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a
conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders
some explanation necessary before we meet.

explanation! you may possibly say, what can elizabeth have to explain? if
you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.
but you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet
be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the
case, i dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, i
have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.

“you well know, victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of
your parents ever since our infancy. we were told this when young, and
taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take
place. we were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, i
believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. but
as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each
other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our
case? tell me, dearest victor. answer me, i conjure you by our mutual
happiness, with simple truth—do you not love another?

“you have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at
ingolstadt; and i confess to you, my friend, that when i saw you last
autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every
creature, i could not help supposing that you might regret our
connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of
your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.
but this is false reasoning. i confess to you, my friend, that i love
you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant
friend and companion. but it is your happiness i desire as well as my
own when i declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally
miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. even now
i weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest
misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that
love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. i, who
have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries
tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. ah! victor, be assured
that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be
made miserable by this supposition. be happy, my friend; and if you
obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth
will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.

“do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the
next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. my uncle
will send me news of your health, and if i see but one smile on your
lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, i
shall need no other happiness.

“elizabeth lavenza.



“geneva, may 18th, 17—”



this letter revived in my memory what i had before forgotten, the threat of
the fiend—“_i will be with you on your
wedding-night!_” such was my sentence, and on that night would the
dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of
happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. on that night he
had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. well, be it so; a
deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were
victorious i should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. if he
were vanquished, i should be a free man. alas! what freedom? such as the
peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his
cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,
penniless, and alone, but free. such would be my liberty except that in my
elizabeth i possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of
remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.

sweet and beloved elizabeth! i read and reread her letter, and some
softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal
dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the
angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. yet i would die to make
her happy. if the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,
again, i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. my
destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer
should suspect that i postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would
surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. he had vowed
_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that
threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that
he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered clerval immediately
after the enunciation of his threats. i resolved, therefore, that if my
immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my
father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life
should not retard it a single hour.

in this state of mind i wrote to elizabeth. my letter was calm and
affectionate. “i fear, my beloved girl,” i said, “little happiness
remains for us on earth; yet all that i may one day enjoy is centred in
you. chase away your idle fears; to you alone do i consecrate my life
and my endeavours for contentment. i have one secret, elizabeth, a
dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with
horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only
wonder that i survive what i have endured. i will confide this tale of
misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,
for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. but
until then, i conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. this i most
earnestly entreat, and i know you will comply.”

in about a week after the arrival of elizabeth’s letter we returned
to geneva. the sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were
in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. i saw a
change in her also. she was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly
vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of
compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as i
was.

the tranquillity which i now enjoyed did not endure. memory brought madness
with it, and when i thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed
me; sometimes i was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and
despondent. i neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,
bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.

elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice
would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human
feelings when sunk in torpor. she wept with me and for me. when reason
returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with
resignation. ah! it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the
guilty there is no peace. the agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is
otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.

soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with
elizabeth. i remained silent.

“have you, then, some other attachment?”

“none on earth. i love elizabeth and look forward to our union with
delight. let the day therefore be fixed; and on it i will consecrate
myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”

“my dear victor, do not speak thus. heavy misfortunes have befallen
us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love
for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. our circle will be
small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.
and when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of
care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly
deprived.”

such were the lessons of my father. but to me the remembrance of the
threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had
yet been in his deeds of blood, i should almost regard him as
invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_i shall be with
you on your wedding-night_,” i should regard the threatened fate as
unavoidable. but death was no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were
balanced with it, and i therefore, with a contented and even cheerful
countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the
ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as i imagined,
the seal to my fate.

great god! if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish
intention of my fiendish adversary, i would rather have banished myself
for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over
the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. but, as if
possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real
intentions; and when i thought that i had prepared only my own death, i
hastened that of a far dearer victim.

as the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or
a prophetic feeling, i felt my heart sink within me. but i concealed my
feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the
countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer
eye of elizabeth. she looked forward to our union with placid contentment,
not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,
that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate
into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.

preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,
and all wore a smiling appearance. i shut up, as well as i could, in my own
heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness
into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the
decorations of my tragedy. through my father’s exertions a part of
the inheritance of elizabeth had been restored to her by the austrian
government. a small possession on the shores of como belonged to her. it
was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to villa
lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake
near which it stood.

in the meantime i took every precaution to defend my person in case the
fiend should openly attack me. i carried pistols and a dagger
constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and
by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. indeed, as the
period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be
regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness i hoped for
in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed
for its solemnisation drew nearer and i heard it continually spoken of
as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.

elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to
calm her mind. but on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my
destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;
and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which i had
promised to reveal to her on the following day. my father was in the
meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in
the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.

after the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my
father’s, but it was agreed that elizabeth and i should commence our
journey by water, sleeping that night at evian and continuing our
voyage on the following day. the day was fair, the wind favourable;
all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.

those were the last moments of my life during which i enjoyed the
feeling of happiness. we passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we
were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the
beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw
mont salêve, the pleasant banks of montalègre, and at a distance,
surmounting all, the beautiful mont blanc, and the assemblage of snowy
mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the
opposite banks, we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the
ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost
insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.

i took the hand of elizabeth. “you are sorrowful, my love. ah! if
you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure, you would
endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this
one day at least permits me to enjoy.”

“be happy, my dear victor,” replied elizabeth; “there is, i hope,
nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not
painted in my face, my heart is contented. something whispers to me
not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but i
will not listen to such a sinister voice. observe how fast we move
along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise
above the dome of mont blanc, render this scene of beauty still more
interesting. look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in
the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at
the bottom. what a divine day! how happy and serene all nature
appears!”

thus elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all
reflection upon melancholy subjects. but her temper was fluctuating;
joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place
to distraction and reverie.

the sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river drance and
observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the
lower hills. the alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached
the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. the
spire of evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range
of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.

the wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,
sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water
and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the
shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and
hay. the sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as i touched
the shore i felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp
me and cling to me for ever.




chapter 23


it was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the
shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and
contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured
in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.

the wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence
in the west. the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was
beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the
flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the
scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves
that were beginning to rise. suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.

i had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the
shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. i was anxious
and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in
my bosom; every sound terrified me, but i resolved that i would sell my
life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that
of my adversary was extinguished.

elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,
but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and
trembling, she asked, “what is it that agitates you, my dear victor?
what is it you fear?”

“oh! peace, peace, my love,” replied i; “this night, and
all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”

i passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly i reflected how
fearful the combat which i momentarily expected would be to my wife,
and i earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her
until i had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.

she left me, and i continued some time walking up and down the passages
of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to
my adversary. but i discovered no trace of him and was beginning to
conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the
execution of his menaces when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful
scream. it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired. as i
heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the
motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; i could feel the blood
trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. this
state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and i rushed
into the room.

great god! why did i not then expire! why am i here to relate the
destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? she was
there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down
and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. everywhere i
turn i see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung
by the murderer on its bridal bier. could i behold this and live? alas!
life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. for a moment
only did i lose recollection; i fell senseless on the ground.

when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their
countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others
appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. i
escaped from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth, my love, my
wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. she had been moved from the
posture in which i had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon
her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, i might have
supposed her asleep. i rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but
the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held
in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished.
the murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the
breath had ceased to issue from her lips.

while i still hung over her in the agony of despair, i happened to look up.
the windows of the room had before been darkened, and i felt a kind of
panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.
the shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be
described, i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.
a grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his
fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. i rushed towards
the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,
leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,
plunged into the lake.

the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. i pointed to
the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with
boats; nets were cast, but in vain. after passing several hours, we
returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a
form conjured up by my fancy. after having landed, they proceeded to
search the country, parties going in different directions among the
woods and vines.

i attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the
house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken
man, i fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my
eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. in this state i
was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had
happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that
i had lost.

after an interval i arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room
where the corpse of my beloved lay. there were women weeping around; i
hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no
distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to
various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their
cause. i was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. the death
of william, the execution of justine, the murder of clerval, and lastly
of my wife; even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining
friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now
might be writhing under his grasp, and ernest might be dead at his
feet. this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. i started
up and resolved to return to geneva with all possible speed.

there were no horses to be procured, and i must return by the lake; but the
wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. however, it was
hardly morning, and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night. i hired men
to row and took an oar myself, for i had always experienced relief from
mental torment in bodily exercise. but the overflowing misery i now felt,
and the excess of agitation that i endured rendered me incapable of any
exertion. i threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way
to every gloomy idea that arose. if i looked up, i saw scenes which were
familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contemplated but the day
before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.
tears streamed from my eyes. the rain had ceased for a moment, and i saw
the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had
then been observed by elizabeth. nothing is so painful to the human mind as
a great and sudden change. the sun might shine or the clouds might lower,
but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. a fiend had
snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been
so miserable as i was; so frightful an event is single in the history of
man.

but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last
overwhelming event? mine has been a tale of horrors; i have reached their
_acme_, and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you. know
that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; i was left desolate. my
own strength is exhausted, and i must tell, in a few words, what remains of
my hideous narration.

i arrived at geneva. my father and ernest yet lived, but the former sunk
under the tidings that i bore. i see him now, excellent and venerable old
man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their
delight—his elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with
all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having
few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. cursed, cursed
be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste
in wretchedness! he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated
around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to
rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.

what then became of me? i know not; i lost sensation, and chains and
darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. sometimes,
indeed, i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales
with the friends of my youth, but i awoke and found myself in a
dungeon. melancholy followed, but by degrees i gained a clear
conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my
prison. for they had called me mad, and during many months, as i
understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.

liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had i not, as i
awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. as the
memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, i began to reflect on their
cause—the monster whom i had created, the miserable dæmon whom i had
sent abroad into the world for my destruction. i was possessed by a
maddening rage when i thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed
that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal
revenge on his cursed head.

nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; i began to
reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about
a month after my release, i repaired to a criminal judge in the town
and told him that i had an accusation to make, that i knew the
destroyer of my family, and that i required him to exert his whole
authority for the apprehension of the murderer.

the magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “be
assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall
be spared to discover the villain.”

“i thank you,” replied i; “listen, therefore, to the
deposition that i have to make. it is indeed a tale so strange that i
should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth
which, however wonderful, forces conviction. the story is too connected to
be mistaken for a dream, and i have no motive for falsehood.” my
manner as i thus addressed him was impressive but calm; i had formed in my
own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose
quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. i now related
my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with
accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.

the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as i continued
he became more attentive and interested; i saw him sometimes shudder with
horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted
on his countenance.

when i had concluded my narration, i said, “this is the being whom i
accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your
whole power. it is your duty as a magistrate, and i believe and hope that
your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those
functions on this occasion.”

this address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own
auditor. he had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given
to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon
to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity
returned. he, however, answered mildly, “i would willingly afford you
every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to
have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. who can follow an
animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where
no man would venture to intrude? besides, some months have elapsed since
the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he
has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”

“i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit, and if
he has indeed taken refuge in the alps, he may be hunted like the chamois
and destroyed as a beast of prey. but i perceive your thoughts; you do not
credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the
punishment which is his desert.”

as i spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.
“you are mistaken,” said he. “i will exert myself, and if
it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer
punishment proportionate to his crimes. but i fear, from what you have
yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove
impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should
make up your mind to disappointment.”

“that cannot be; but all that i can say will be of little avail. my
revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while i allow it to be a vice, i
confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. my rage
is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer, whom i have turned
loose upon society, still exists. you refuse my just demand; i have
but one resource, and i devote myself, either in my life or death, to
his destruction.”

i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this; there was a frenzy
in my manner, and something, i doubt not, of that haughty fierceness
which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. but to a genevan
magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of
devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of
madness. he endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and
reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.

“man,” i cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
wisdom! cease; you know not what it is you say.”

i broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on
some other mode of action.




chapter 24


my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was
swallowed up and lost. i was hurried away by fury; revenge alone
endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and
allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise
delirium or death would have been my portion.

my first resolution was to quit geneva for ever; my country, which, when i
was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became
hateful. i provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels
which had belonged to my mother, and departed.

and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. i have
traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships
which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. how i
have lived i hardly know; many times have i stretched my failing limbs upon
the sandy plain and prayed for death. but revenge kept me alive; i dared
not die and leave my adversary in being.

when i quitted geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which i
might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. but my plan was unsettled,
and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain
what path i should pursue. as night approached i found myself at the
entrance of the cemetery where william, elizabeth, and my father
reposed. i entered it and approached the tomb which marked their
graves. everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which
were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the
scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested
observer. the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to
cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the
mourner.

the deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to
rage and despair. they were dead, and i lived; their murderer also lived,
and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence. i knelt on the grass
and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “by the
sacred earth on which i kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the
deep and eternal grief that i feel, i swear; and by thee, o night, and the
spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,
until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict. for this purpose i will
preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will i again behold the sun
and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
eyes for ever. and i call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering
ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. let the cursed
and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now
torments me.”

i had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me
that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but
the furies possessed me as i concluded, and rage choked my utterance.

i was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish
laugh. it rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed
it, and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.
surely in that moment i should have been possessed by frenzy and have
destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that i
was reserved for vengeance. the laughter died away, when a well-known
and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an
audible whisper, “i am satisfied, miserable wretch! you have
determined to live, and i am satisfied.”

i darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil
eluded my grasp. suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone
full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than
mortal speed.

i pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. guided by a
slight clue, i followed the windings of the rhone, but vainly. the
blue mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, i saw the fiend
enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea. i
took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, i know not how.

amidst the wilds of tartary and russia, although he still evaded me, i
have ever followed in his track. sometimes the peasants, scared by
this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,
who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die,
left some mark to guide me. the snows descended on my head, and i saw
the print of his huge step on the white plain. to you first entering
on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand
what i have felt and still feel? cold, want, and fatigue were the
least pains which i was destined to endure; i was cursed by some devil
and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good
followed and directed my steps and when i most murmured would suddenly
extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. sometimes,
when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast
was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. the
fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but
i will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that i had
invoked to aid me. often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and
i was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the
few drops that revived me, and vanish.

i followed, when i could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon
generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the
country chiefly collected. in other places human beings were seldom
seen, and i generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my
path. i had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers
by distributing it; or i brought with me some food that i had killed,
which, after taking a small part, i always presented to those who had
provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.

my life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during
sleep alone that i could taste joy. o blessed sleep! often, when most
miserable, i sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. the
spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of
happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. deprived of
this respite, i should have sunk under my hardships. during the day i was
sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep i saw my
friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again i saw the benevolent
countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my elizabeth’s
voice, and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth. often, when wearied by
a toilsome march, i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should
come and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest
friends. what agonising fondness did i feel for them! how did i cling to
their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and
persuade myself that they still lived! at such moments vengeance, that
burned within me, died in my heart, and i pursued my path towards the
destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the
mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious, than as the
ardent desire of my soul.

what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know. sometimes, indeed, he
left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided
me and instigated my fury. “my reign is not yet
over”—these words were legible in one of these
inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. follow me; i
seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of
cold and frost, to which i am impassive. you will find near this place, if
you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. come on, my
enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable
hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”

scoffing devil! again do i vow vengeance; again do i devote thee,
miserable fiend, to torture and death. never will i give up my search
until he or i perish; and then with what ecstasy shall i join my
elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the
reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!

as i still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the
cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. the peasants were
shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to
seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to
seek for prey. the rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be
procured; and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.

the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. one
inscription that he left was in these words: “prepare! your toils
only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter
upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting
hatred.”

my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; i
resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven to support
me, i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,
until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary
of the horizon. oh! how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the
south! covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by
its superior wildness and ruggedness. the greeks wept for joy when
they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia, and hailed with
rapture the boundary of their toils. i did not weep, but i knelt down
and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in
safety to the place where i hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,
to meet and grapple with him.

some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus
traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. i know not whether the
fiend possessed the same advantages, but i found that, as before i had
daily lost ground in the pursuit, i now gained on him, so much so that
when i first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and
i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. with new
courage, therefore, i pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched
hamlet on the seashore. i inquired of the inhabitants concerning the
fiend and gained accurate information. a gigantic monster, they said,
had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,
putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of
his terrific appearance. he had carried off their store of winter
food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a
numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same
night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his
journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they
conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the
ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.

on hearing this information i suffered a temporary access of despair.
he had escaped me, and i must commence a destructive and almost endless
journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few
of the inhabitants could long endure and which i, the native of a
genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. yet at the idea
that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance
returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.
after a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered
round and instigated me to toil and revenge, i prepared for my journey.

i exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of
the frozen ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, i
departed from land.

i cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but i have endured
misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution
burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. immense and
rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and i often heard
the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. but
again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.

by the quantity of provision which i had consumed, i should guess that
i had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction
of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of
despondency and grief from my eyes. despair had indeed almost secured
her prey, and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery. once, after
the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the
summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,
died, i viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye
caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. i strained my sight to
discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i
distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known
form within. oh! with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!
warm tears filled my eyes, which i hastily wiped away, that they might
not intercept the view i had of the dæmon; but still my sight was
dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that
oppressed me, i wept aloud.

but this was not the time for delay; i disencumbered the dogs of their
dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an
hour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly
irksome to me, i continued my route. the sledge was still visible, nor
did i again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short
time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. i indeed
perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, i
beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within
me.

but now, when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were
suddenly extinguished, and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had
ever done before. a ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as
the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous
and terrific. i pressed on, but in vain. the wind arose; the sea roared;
and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a
tremendous and overwhelming sound. the work was soon finished; in a few
minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and i was left
drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and
thus preparing for me a hideous death.

in this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and i
myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your
vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.
i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded
at the sight. i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and
by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in
the direction of your ship. i had determined, if you were going southwards,
still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my
purpose. i hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which i could pursue
my enemy. but your direction was northwards. you took me on board when my
vigour was exhausted, and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied
hardships into a death which i still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.

oh! when will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow
me the rest i so much desire; or must i die, and he yet live? if i do,
swear to me, walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him
and satisfy my vengeance in his death. and do i dare to ask of you to
undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that i have undergone?
no; i am not so selfish. yet, when i am dead, if he should appear, if
the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he
shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated
woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. he is eloquent
and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but
trust him not. his soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery
and fiend-like malice. hear him not; call on the names of william,
justine, clerval, elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched victor, and
thrust your sword into his heart. i will hover near and direct the
steel aright.

walton, _in continuation._


august 26th, 17—.


you have read this strange and terrific story, margaret; and do you not
feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles
mine? sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his
tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with
difficulty the words so replete with anguish. his fine and lovely eyes
were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow
and quenched in infinite wretchedness. sometimes he commanded his
countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a
tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a
volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression
of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.

his tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,
yet i own to you that the letters of felix and safie, which he showed me,
and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a
greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,
however earnest and connected. such a monster has, then, really existence!
i cannot doubt it, yet i am lost in surprise and admiration. sometimes i
endeavoured to gain from frankenstein the particulars of his
creature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.

“are you mad, my friend?” said he. “or whither does your
senseless curiosity lead you? would you also create for yourself and the
world a demoniacal enemy? peace, peace! learn my miseries and do not seek
to increase your own.”

frankenstein discovered that i made notes concerning his history; he asked
to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,
but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held
with his enemy. “since you have preserved my narration,” said
he, “i would not that a mutilated one should go down to
posterity.”

thus has a week passed away, while i have listened to the strangest
tale that ever imagination formed. my thoughts and every feeling of my
soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale
and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. i wish to soothe
him, yet can i counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of
every hope of consolation, to live? oh, no! the only joy that he can
now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and
death. yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and
delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his
friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or
excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his
fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a
remote world. this faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render
them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.

our conversations are not always confined to his own history and
misfortunes. on every point of general literature he displays
unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. his
eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can i hear him, when he relates
a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,
without tears. what a glorious creature must he have been in the days
of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! he seems
to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.

“when younger,” said he, “i believed myself destined for
some great enterprise. my feelings are profound, but i possessed a coolness
of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. this sentiment of
the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,
for i deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that
might be useful to my fellow creatures. when i reflected on the work i had
completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational
animal, i could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. but
this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now
serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. all my speculations and hopes
are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, i am
chained in an eternal hell. my imagination was vivid, yet my powers of
analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities i
conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. even now i cannot
recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. i trod
heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea
of their effects. from my infancy i was imbued with high hopes and a lofty
ambition; but how am i sunk! oh! my friend, if you had known me as i once
was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. despondency
rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until i fell,
never, never again to rise.”

must i then lose this admirable being? i have longed for a friend; i have
sought one who would sympathise with and love me. behold, on these desert
seas i have found such a one, but i fear i have gained him only to know his
value and lose him. i would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.

“i thank you, walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so
miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh
affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? can any
man be to me as clerval was, or any woman another elizabeth? even
where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,
the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our
minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. they know our
infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,
are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more
certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. a sister or a
brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,
suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,
however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be
contemplated with suspicion. but i enjoyed friends, dear not only
through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever
i am, the soothing voice of my elizabeth and the conversation of
clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. they are dead, and but one
feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. if i
were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive
utility to my fellow creatures, then could i live to fulfil it. but
such is not my destiny; i must pursue and destroy the being to whom i
gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and i may die.”

my beloved sister,

september 2d.


i write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether i am ever
doomed to see again dear england and the dearer friends that inhabit
it. i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and
threaten every moment to crush my vessel. the brave fellows whom i
have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but i have
none to bestow. there is something terribly appalling in our
situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. yet it is
terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered
through me. if we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.

and what, margaret, will be the state of your mind? you will not hear of my
destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. years will pass, and
you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. oh! my
beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,
in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. but you have a husband
and lovely children; you may be happy. heaven bless you and make you so!

my unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. he
endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession
which he valued. he reminds me how often the same accidents have
happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite
of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. even the sailors feel
the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he
rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these
vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the
resolutions of man. these feelings are transitory; each day of
expectation delayed fills them with fear, and i almost dread a mutiny
caused by this despair.

september 5th.


a scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is
highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet i cannot
forbear recording it.

we are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger
of being crushed in their conflict. the cold is excessive, and many of
my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of
desolation. frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire
still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly
roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent
lifelessness.

i mentioned in my last letter the fears i entertained of a mutiny.
this morning, as i sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his
eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—i was roused by half
a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. they
entered, and their leader addressed me. he told me that he and his
companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation
to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, i could not refuse.
we were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they
feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free
passage be opened, i should be rash enough to continue my voyage and
lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted
this. they insisted, therefore, that i should engage with a solemn
promise that if the vessel should be freed i would instantly direct my
course southwards.

this speech troubled me. i had not despaired, nor had i yet conceived
the idea of returning if set free. yet could i, in justice, or even in
possibility, refuse this demand? i hesitated before i answered, when
frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly
to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,
and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. turning towards the men,
he said,

“what do you mean? what do you demand of your captain? are you, then,
so easily turned from your design? did you not call this a glorious
expedition? “and wherefore was it glorious? not because the way was
smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and
terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth
and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and
these you were to brave and overcome. for this was it a glorious, for this
was it an honourable undertaking. you were hereafter to be hailed as the
benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men
who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. and now,
behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first
mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content
to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and
peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm
firesides. why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come
thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove
yourselves cowards. oh! be men, or be more than men. be steady to your
purposes and firm as a rock. this ice is not made of such stuff as your
hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it
shall not. do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace
marked on your brows. return as heroes who have fought and conquered and
who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”

he spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed
in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can
you wonder that these men were moved? they looked at one another and were
unable to reply. i spoke; i told them to retire and consider of what had
been said, that i would not lead them farther north if they strenuously
desired the contrary, but that i hoped that, with reflection, their courage
would return.

they retired and i turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and
almost deprived of life.

how all this will terminate, i know not, but i had rather die than
return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. yet i fear such will be my
fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never
willingly continue to endure their present hardships.

september 7th.


the die is cast; i have consented to return if we are not destroyed.
thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; i come back
ignorant and disappointed. it requires more philosophy than i possess
to bear this injustice with patience.

september 12th.


it is past; i am returning to england. i have lost my hopes of utility
and glory; i have lost my friend. but i will endeavour to detail these
bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while i am wafted
towards england and towards you, i will not despond.

september 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard
at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. we were
in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief
attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in
such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. the ice cracked
behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from
the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly
free. when the sailors saw this and that their return to their native
country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,
loud and long-continued. frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the
cause of the tumult. “they shout,” i said, “because they
will soon return to england.”

“do you, then, really return?”

“alas! yes; i cannot withstand their demands. i cannot lead them
unwillingly to danger, and i must return.”

“do so, if you will; but i will not. you may give up your purpose, but
mine is assigned to me by heaven, and i dare not. i am weak, but
surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with
sufficient strength.” saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the
bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.

it was long before he was restored, and i often thought that life was
entirely extinct. at length he opened his eyes; he breathed with
difficulty and was unable to speak. the surgeon gave him a composing
draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. in the meantime he
told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.

his sentence was pronounced, and i could only grieve and be patient. i sat
by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and i thought he slept; but
presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,
said, “alas! the strength i relied on is gone; i feel that i shall
soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. think
not, walton, that in the last moments of my existence i feel that burning
hatred and ardent desire of revenge i once expressed; but i feel myself
justified in desiring the death of my adversary. during these last days i
have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do i find it blamable.
in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was
bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and
well-being. this was my duty, but there was another still paramount to
that. my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to
my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or
misery. urged by this view, i refused, and i did right in refusing, to
create a companion for the first creature. he showed unparalleled malignity
and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction
beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do i
know where this thirst for vengeance may end. miserable himself that he may
render no other wretched, he ought to die. the task of his destruction was
mine, but i have failed. when actuated by selfish and vicious motives, i
asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and i renew this request now,
when i am only induced by reason and virtue.

“yet i cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil
this task; and now that you are returning to england, you will have
little chance of meeting with him. but the consideration of these
points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, i
leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near
approach of death. i dare not ask you to do what i think right, for i
may still be misled by passion.

“that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in
other respects, this hour, when i momentarily expect my release, is the
only happy one which i have enjoyed for several years. the forms of
the beloved dead flit before me, and i hasten to their arms. farewell,
walton! seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it
be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in
science and discoveries. yet why do i say this? i have myself been
blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”

his voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his
effort, he sank into silence. about half an hour afterwards he
attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and
his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed
away from his lips.

margaret, what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this
glorious spirit? what can i say that will enable you to understand the
depth of my sorrow? all that i should express would be inadequate and
feeble. my tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
disappointment. but i journey towards england, and i may there find
consolation.

i am interrupted. what do these sounds portend? it is midnight; the
breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. again there
is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin
where the remains of frankenstein still lie. i must arise and examine.
good night, my sister.

great god! what a scene has just taken place! i am yet dizzy with the
remembrance of it. i hardly know whether i shall have the power to detail
it; yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this
final and wonderful catastrophe.

i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable
friend. over him hung a form which i cannot find words to
describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its
proportions. as he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long
locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and
apparent texture like that of a mummy. when he heard the sound of my
approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung
towards the window. never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face, of
such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. i shut my eyes involuntarily and
endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.
i called on him to stay.

he paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the
lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and
every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some
uncontrollable passion.

“that is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “in his murder my
crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its
close! oh, frankenstein! generous and self-devoted being! what does it
avail that i now ask thee to pardon me? i, who irretrievably destroyed thee
by destroying all thou lovedst. alas! he is cold, he cannot answer
me.”

his voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to
me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his
enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. i
approached this tremendous being; i dared not again raise my eyes to his
face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. i
attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. the monster
continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. at length i
gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.

“your repentance,” i said, “is now superfluous. if you
had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse
before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,
frankenstein would yet have lived.”

“and do you dream?” said the dæmon. “do you think that i was then
dead to agony and remorse? he,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,
“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. oh! not the
ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the
lingering detail of its execution. a frightful selfishness hurried me
on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. think you that the
groans of clerval were music to my ears? my heart was fashioned to be
susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice
and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without
torture such as you cannot even imagine.

“after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland, heart-broken
and overcome. i pitied frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; i
abhorred myself. but when i discovered that he, the author at once of
my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for
happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me
he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the
indulgence of which i was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter
indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. i
recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. i
knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but i was the
slave, not the master, of an impulse which i detested yet could not
disobey. yet when she died! nay, then i was not miserable. i had
cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my
despair. evil thenceforth became my good. urged thus far, i had no
choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly
chosen. the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable
passion. and now it is ended; there is my last victim!”

i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when i called
to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and
persuasion, and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my
friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “wretch!” i said.
“it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you
have made. you throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are
consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. hypocritical fiend!
if he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would
he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. it is not pity that you
feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn
from your power.”

“oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.
“yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to
be the purport of my actions. yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.
no sympathy may i ever find. when i first sought it, it was the love of
virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being
overflowed, that i wished to be participated. but now that virtue has
become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into
bitter and loathing despair, in what should i seek for sympathy? i am
content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when i die, i am
well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. once
my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. once
i falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would
love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding. i was
nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. but now crime has
degraded me beneath the meanest animal. no guilt, no mischief, no
malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. when i run over the
frightful catalogue of my sins, i cannot believe that i am the same
creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent
visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. but it is even so; the
fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. yet even that enemy of god and man
had friends and associates in his desolation; i am alone.

“you, who call frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my
crimes and his misfortunes. but in the detail which he gave you of them
he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which i endured
wasting in impotent passions. for while i destroyed his hopes, i did
not satisfy my own desires. they were for ever ardent and craving; still
i desired love and fellowship, and i was still spurned. was there no
injustice in this? am i to be thought the only criminal, when all
humankind sinned against me? why do you not hate felix, who drove his
friend from his door with contumely? why do you not execrate the rustic
who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? nay, these are virtuous
and immaculate beings! i, the miserable and the abandoned, am an
abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. even now my
blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.

“but it is true that i am a wretch. i have murdered the lovely and
the helpless; i have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to
death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. i have
devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and
admiration among men, to misery; i have pursued him even to that
irremediable ruin. there he lies, white and cold in death. you hate me, but
your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself. i look on the
hands which executed the deed; i think on the heart in which the
imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands
will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.

“fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief. my work
is nearly complete. neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to
consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,
but it requires my own. do not think that i shall be slow to perform this
sacrifice. i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me
thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; i shall
collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its
remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would
create such another as i have been. i shall die. i shall no longer feel the
agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet
unquenched. he is dead who called me into being; and when i shall be no
more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. i shall no
longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. light,
feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must i find my
happiness. some years ago, when the images which this world affords first
opened upon me, when i felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the
rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to
me, i should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. polluted by
crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can i find rest but in
death?

“farewell! i leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these
eyes will ever behold. farewell, frankenstein! if thou wert yet alive
and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better
satiated in my life than in my destruction. but it was not so; thou
didst seek my extinction, that i might not cause greater wretchedness;
and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think
and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than
that which i feel. blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to
thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my
wounds until death shall close them for ever.

“but soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “i
shall die, and what i now feel be no longer felt. soon these burning
miseries will be extinct. i shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and
exult in the agony of the torturing flames. the light of that conflagration
will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. my spirit
will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.
farewell.”

he sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft
which lay close to the vessel. he was soon borne away by the waves and
lost in darkness and distance.

section 2. information about the mission of project gutenberg™

project gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. it
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg™ and future
generations. to learn more about the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

project gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

status with the irs.

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states. compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. we do not solicit donations in locations

donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

the prologue


 enter chorus.

chorus.
two households, both alike in dignity,
in fair verona, where we lay our scene,
from ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
a pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
the fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
and the continuance of their parents’ rage,
which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
the which, if you with patient ears attend,
what here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

 [_exit._]




act i

scene i. a public place.


 enter sampson and gregory armed with swords and bucklers.

sampson.
gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.

gregory.
no, for then we should be colliers.

sampson.
i mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.

gregory.
ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.

sampson.
i strike quickly, being moved.

gregory.
but thou art not quickly moved to strike.

sampson.
a dog of the house of montague moves me.

gregory.
to move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou
art moved, thou runn’st away.

sampson.
a dog of that house shall move me to stand.
i will take the wall of any man or maid of montague’s.

gregory.
that shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.

sampson.
true, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to
the wall: therefore i will push montague’s men from the wall, and
thrust his maids to the wall.

gregory.
the quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

sampson.
’tis all one, i will show myself a tyrant: when i have fought with the
men i will be civil with the maids, i will cut off their heads.

gregory.
the heads of the maids?

sampson.
ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
thou wilt.

gregory.
they must take it in sense that feel it.

sampson.
me they shall feel while i am able to stand: and ’tis known i am a
pretty piece of flesh.

gregory.
’tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor john.
draw thy tool; here comes of the house of montagues.

 enter abram and balthasar.

sampson.
my naked weapon is out: quarrel, i will back thee.

gregory.
how? turn thy back and run?

sampson.
fear me not.

gregory.
no, marry; i fear thee!

sampson.
let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

gregory.
i will frown as i pass by, and let them take it as they list.

sampson.
nay, as they dare. i will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to
them if they bear it.

abram.
do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

sampson.
i do bite my thumb, sir.

abram.
do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

sampson.
is the law of our side if i say ay?

gregory.
no.

sampson.
no sir, i do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but i bite my thumb, sir.

gregory.
do you quarrel, sir?

abram.
quarrel, sir? no, sir.

sampson.
but if you do, sir, i am for you. i serve as good a man as you.

abram.
no better.

sampson.
well, sir.

 enter benvolio.

gregory.
say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.

sampson.
yes, better, sir.

abram.
you lie.

sampson.
draw, if you be men. gregory, remember thy washing blow.

 [_they fight._]

benvolio.
part, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.

 [_beats down their swords._]

 enter tybalt.

tybalt.
what, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
turn thee benvolio, look upon thy death.

benvolio.
i do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,
or manage it to part these men with me.

tybalt.
what, drawn, and talk of peace? i hate the word
as i hate hell, all montagues, and thee:
have at thee, coward.

 [_they fight._]

 enter three or four citizens with clubs.

first citizen.
clubs, bills and partisans! strike! beat them down!
down with the capulets! down with the montagues!

 enter capulet in his gown, and lady capulet.

capulet.
what noise is this? give me my long sword, ho!

lady capulet.
a crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

capulet.
my sword, i say! old montague is come,
and flourishes his blade in spite of me.

 enter montague and his lady montague.

montague.
thou villain capulet! hold me not, let me go.

lady montague.
thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.

 enter prince escalus, with attendants.

prince.
rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
will they not hear? what, ho! you men, you beasts,
that quench the fire of your pernicious rage
with purple fountains issuing from your veins,
on pain of torture, from those bloody hands
throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground
and hear the sentence of your moved prince.
three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
by thee, old capulet, and montague,
have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,
and made verona’s ancient citizens
cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
to wield old partisans, in hands as old,
canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.
if ever you disturb our streets again,
your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
for this time all the rest depart away:
you, capulet, shall go along with me,
and montague, come you this afternoon,
to know our farther pleasure in this case,
to old free-town, our common judgement-place.
once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

 [_exeunt prince and attendants; capulet, lady capulet, tybalt,
 citizens and servants._]

montague.
who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

benvolio.
here were the servants of your adversary
and yours, close fighting ere i did approach.
i drew to part them, in the instant came
the fiery tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,
which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,
he swung about his head, and cut the winds,
who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.
while we were interchanging thrusts and blows
came more and more, and fought on part and part,
till the prince came, who parted either part.

lady montague.
o where is romeo, saw you him today?
right glad i am he was not at this fray.

benvolio.
madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun
peer’d forth the golden window of the east,
a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,
where underneath the grove of sycamore
that westward rooteth from this city side,
so early walking did i see your son.
towards him i made, but he was ware of me,
and stole into the covert of the wood.
i, measuring his affections by my own,
which then most sought where most might not be found,
being one too many by my weary self,
pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,
and gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.

montague.
many a morning hath he there been seen,
with tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
but all so soon as the all-cheering sun
should in the farthest east begin to draw
the shady curtains from aurora’s bed,
away from light steals home my heavy son,
and private in his chamber pens himself,
shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
and makes himself an artificial night.
black and portentous must this humour prove,
unless good counsel may the cause remove.

benvolio.
my noble uncle, do you know the cause?

montague.
i neither know it nor can learn of him.

benvolio.
have you importun’d him by any means?

montague.
both by myself and many other friends;
but he, his own affections’ counsellor,
is to himself—i will not say how true—
but to himself so secret and so close,
so far from sounding and discovery,
as is the bud bit with an envious worm
ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
we would as willingly give cure as know.

 enter romeo.

benvolio.
see, where he comes. so please you step aside;
i’ll know his grievance or be much denied.

montague.
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift. come, madam, let’s away,

 [_exeunt montague and lady montague._]

benvolio.
good morrow, cousin.

romeo.
is the day so young?

benvolio.
but new struck nine.

romeo.
ay me, sad hours seem long.
was that my father that went hence so fast?

benvolio.
it was. what sadness lengthens romeo’s hours?

romeo.
not having that which, having, makes them short.

benvolio.
in love?

romeo.
out.

benvolio.
of love?

romeo.
out of her favour where i am in love.

benvolio.
alas that love so gentle in his view,
should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.

romeo.
alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
where shall we dine? o me! what fray was here?
yet tell me not, for i have heard it all.
here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:
why, then, o brawling love! o loving hate!
o anything, of nothing first create!
o heavy lightness! serious vanity!
misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
this love feel i, that feel no love in this.
dost thou not laugh?

benvolio.
no coz, i rather weep.

romeo.
good heart, at what?

benvolio.
at thy good heart’s oppression.

romeo.
why such is love’s transgression.
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
with more of thine. this love that thou hast shown
doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;
being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:
what is it else? a madness most discreet,
a choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
farewell, my coz.

 [_going._]

benvolio.
soft! i will go along:
and if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

romeo.
tut! i have lost myself; i am not here.
this is not romeo, he’s some other where.

benvolio.
tell me in sadness who is that you love?

romeo.
what, shall i groan and tell thee?

benvolio.
groan! why, no; but sadly tell me who.

romeo.
bid a sick man in sadness make his will,
a word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.
in sadness, cousin, i do love a woman.

benvolio.
i aim’d so near when i suppos’d you lov’d.

romeo.
a right good markman, and she’s fair i love.

benvolio.
a right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

romeo.
well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit
with cupid’s arrow, she hath dian’s wit;
and in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,
from love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.
she will not stay the siege of loving terms
nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,
nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
o she’s rich in beauty, only poor
that when she dies, with beauty dies her store.

benvolio.
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

romeo.
she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
for beauty starv’d with her severity,
cuts beauty off from all posterity.
she is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
to merit bliss by making me despair.
she hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
do i live dead, that live to tell it now.

benvolio.
be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.

romeo.
o teach me how i should forget to think.

benvolio.
by giving liberty unto thine eyes;
examine other beauties.

romeo.
’tis the way
to call hers, exquisite, in question more.
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,
being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
he that is strucken blind cannot forget
the precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
show me a mistress that is passing fair,
what doth her beauty serve but as a note
where i may read who pass’d that passing fair?
farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.

benvolio.
i’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. a street.

 enter capulet, paris and servant.

capulet.
but montague is bound as well as i,
in penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, i think,
for men so old as we to keep the peace.

paris.
of honourable reckoning are you both,
and pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.
but now my lord, what say you to my suit?

capulet.
but saying o’er what i have said before.
my child is yet a stranger in the world,
she hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
let two more summers wither in their pride
ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

paris.
younger than she are happy mothers made.

capulet.
and too soon marr’d are those so early made.
the earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,
she is the hopeful lady of my earth:
but woo her, gentle paris, get her heart,
my will to her consent is but a part;
and she agree, within her scope of choice
lies my consent and fair according voice.
this night i hold an old accustom’d feast,
whereto i have invited many a guest,
such as i love, and you among the store,
one more, most welcome, makes my number more.
at my poor house look to behold this night
earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
such comfort as do lusty young men feel
when well apparell’d april on the heel
of limping winter treads, even such delight
among fresh female buds shall you this night
inherit at my house. hear all, all see,
and like her most whose merit most shall be:
which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
may stand in number, though in reckoning none.
come, go with me. go, sirrah, trudge about
through fair verona; find those persons out
whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,
my house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

 [_exeunt capulet and paris._]

servant.
find them out whose names are written here! it is written that the
shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the
fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but i am sent to
find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what
names the writing person hath here writ. i must to the learned. in good
time!

 enter benvolio and romeo.

benvolio.
tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,
one pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;
turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
one desperate grief cures with another’s languish:
take thou some new infection to thy eye,
and the rank poison of the old will die.

romeo.
your plantain leaf is excellent for that.

benvolio.
for what, i pray thee?

romeo.
for your broken shin.

benvolio.
why, romeo, art thou mad?

romeo.
not mad, but bound more than a madman is:
shut up in prison, kept without my food,
whipp’d and tormented and—god-den, good fellow.

servant.
god gi’ go-den. i pray, sir, can you read?

romeo.
ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

servant.
perhaps you have learned it without book.
but i pray, can you read anything you see?

romeo.
ay, if i know the letters and the language.

servant.
ye say honestly, rest you merry!

romeo.
stay, fellow; i can read.

 [_he reads the letter._]

_signior martino and his wife and daughters;
county anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
the lady widow of utruvio;
signior placentio and his lovely nieces;
mercutio and his brother valentine;
mine uncle capulet, his wife, and daughters;
my fair niece rosaline and livia;
signior valentio and his cousin tybalt;
lucio and the lively helena. _


a fair assembly. [_gives back the paper_] whither should they come?

servant.
up.

romeo.
whither to supper?

servant.
to our house.

romeo.
whose house?

servant.
my master’s.

romeo.
indeed i should have ask’d you that before.

servant.
now i’ll tell you without asking. my master is the great rich capulet,
and if you be not of the house of montagues, i pray come and crush a
cup of wine. rest you merry.

 [_exit._]

benvolio.
at this same ancient feast of capulet’s
sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lov’st;
with all the admired beauties of verona.
go thither and with unattainted eye,
compare her face with some that i shall show,
and i will make thee think thy swan a crow.

romeo.
when the devout religion of mine eye
maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;
and these who, often drown’d, could never die,
transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.
one fairer than my love? the all-seeing sun
ne’er saw her match since first the world begun.

benvolio.
tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
herself pois’d with herself in either eye:
but in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d
your lady’s love against some other maid
that i will show you shining at this feast,
and she shall scant show well that now shows best.

romeo.
i’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,
but to rejoice in splendour of my own.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. room in capulet’s house.

 enter lady capulet and nurse.

lady capulet.
nurse, where’s my daughter? call her forth to me.

nurse.
now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
i bade her come. what, lamb! what ladybird!
god forbid! where’s this girl? what, juliet!

 enter juliet.

juliet.
how now, who calls?

nurse.
your mother.

juliet.
madam, i am here. what is your will?

lady capulet.
this is the matter. nurse, give leave awhile,
we must talk in secret. nurse, come back again,
i have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.
thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.

nurse.
faith, i can tell her age unto an hour.

lady capulet.
she’s not fourteen.

nurse.
i’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,
and yet, to my teen be it spoken, i have but four,
she is not fourteen. how long is it now
to lammas-tide?

lady capulet.
a fortnight and odd days.

nurse.
even or odd, of all days in the year,
come lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen.
susan and she,—god rest all christian souls!—
were of an age. well, susan is with god;
she was too good for me. but as i said,
on lammas eve at night shall she be fourteen;
that shall she, marry; i remember it well.
’tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
and she was wean’d,—i never shall forget it—,
of all the days of the year, upon that day:
for i had then laid wormwood to my dug,
sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;
my lord and you were then at mantua:
nay, i do bear a brain. but as i said,
when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
to see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, i trow,
to bid me trudge.
and since that time it is eleven years;
for then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood
she could have run and waddled all about;
for even the day before she broke her brow,
and then my husband,—god be with his soul!
a was a merry man,—took up the child:
‘yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?
thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
wilt thou not, jule?’ and, by my holidame,
the pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘ay’.
to see now how a jest shall come about.
i warrant, and i should live a thousand years,
i never should forget it. ‘wilt thou not, jule?’ quoth he;
and, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘ay.’

lady capulet.
enough of this; i pray thee hold thy peace.

nurse.
yes, madam, yet i cannot choose but laugh,
to think it should leave crying, and say ‘ay’;
and yet i warrant it had upon it brow
a bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;
a perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
‘yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?
thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
wilt thou not, jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘ay’.

juliet.
and stint thou too, i pray thee, nurse, say i.

nurse.
peace, i have done. god mark thee to his grace
thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er i nurs’d:
and i might live to see thee married once, i have my wish.

lady capulet.
marry, that marry is the very theme
i came to talk of. tell me, daughter juliet,
how stands your disposition to be married?

juliet.
it is an honour that i dream not of.

nurse.
an honour! were not i thine only nurse,
i would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.

lady capulet.
well, think of marriage now: younger than you,
here in verona, ladies of esteem,
are made already mothers. by my count
i was your mother much upon these years
that you are now a maid. thus, then, in brief;
the valiant paris seeks you for his love.

nurse.
a man, young lady! lady, such a man
as all the world—why he’s a man of wax.

lady capulet.
verona’s summer hath not such a flower.

nurse.
nay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower.

lady capulet.
what say you, can you love the gentleman?
this night you shall behold him at our feast;
read o’er the volume of young paris’ face,
and find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.
examine every married lineament,
and see how one another lends content;
and what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,
find written in the margent of his eyes.
this precious book of love, this unbound lover,
to beautify him, only lacks a cover:
the fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride
for fair without the fair within to hide.
that book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,
that in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
so shall you share all that he doth possess,
by having him, making yourself no less.

nurse.
no less, nay bigger. women grow by men.

lady capulet.
speak briefly, can you like of paris’ love?

juliet.
i’ll look to like, if looking liking move:
but no more deep will i endart mine eye
than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

 enter a servant.

servant.
madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady
asked for, the nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.
i must hence to wait, i beseech you follow straight.

lady capulet.
we follow thee.

 [_exit servant._]

juliet, the county stays.

nurse.
go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iv. a street.

 enter romeo, mercutio, benvolio, with five or six maskers;
 torch-bearers and others.

romeo.
what, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
or shall we on without apology?

benvolio.
the date is out of such prolixity:
we’ll have no cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,
bearing a tartar’s painted bow of lath,
scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
after the prompter, for our entrance:
but let them measure us by what they will,
we’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.

romeo.
give me a torch, i am not for this ambling;
being but heavy i will bear the light.

mercutio.
nay, gentle romeo, we must have you dance.

romeo.
not i, believe me, you have dancing shoes,
with nimble soles, i have a soul of lead
so stakes me to the ground i cannot move.

mercutio.
you are a lover, borrow cupid’s wings,
and soar with them above a common bound.

romeo.
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
to soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
under love’s heavy burden do i sink.

mercutio.
and, to sink in it, should you burden love;
too great oppression for a tender thing.

romeo.
is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.

mercutio.
if love be rough with you, be rough with love;
prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
give me a case to put my visage in: [_putting on a mask._]
a visor for a visor. what care i
what curious eye doth quote deformities?
here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.

benvolio.
come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
but every man betake him to his legs.

romeo.
a torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,
tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
for i am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,
i’ll be a candle-holder and look on,
the game was ne’er so fair, and i am done.

mercutio.
tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:
if thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire
or save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest
up to the ears. come, we burn daylight, ho.

romeo.
nay, that’s not so.

mercutio.
i mean sir, in delay
we waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.
take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
five times in that ere once in our five wits.

romeo.
and we mean well in going to this mask;
but ’tis no wit to go.

mercutio.
why, may one ask?

romeo.
i dreamt a dream tonight.

mercutio.
and so did i.

romeo.
well what was yours?

mercutio.
that dreamers often lie.

romeo.
in bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

mercutio.
o, then, i see queen mab hath been with you.
she is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes
in shape no bigger than an agate-stone
on the fore-finger of an alderman,
drawn with a team of little atomies
over men’s noses as they lie asleep:
her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;
the cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;
the collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;
her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;
her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
not half so big as a round little worm
prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:
her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.
and in this state she gallops night by night
through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;
o’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
o’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;
o’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,
which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues,
because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,
and then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
and sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,
tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,
then dreams he of another benefice:
sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,
and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
of breaches, ambuscados, spanish blades,
of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
and, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
and sleeps again. this is that very mab
that plats the manes of horses in the night;
and bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
this is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
that presses them, and learns them first to bear,
making them women of good carriage:
this is she,—

romeo.
peace, peace, mercutio, peace,
thou talk’st of nothing.

mercutio.
true, i talk of dreams,
which are the children of an idle brain,
begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
which is as thin of substance as the air,
and more inconstant than the wind, who woos
even now the frozen bosom of the north,
and, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,
turning his side to the dew-dropping south.

benvolio.
this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
supper is done, and we shall come too late.

romeo.
i fear too early: for my mind misgives
some consequence yet hanging in the stars,
shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night’s revels; and expire the term
of a despised life, clos’d in my breast
by some vile forfeit of untimely death.
but he that hath the steerage of my course
direct my suit. on, lusty gentlemen!

benvolio.
strike, drum.

scene v. a hall in capulet’s house.

 musicians waiting. enter servants.

first servant.
where’s potpan, that he helps not to take away?
he shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!

second servant.
when good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they
unwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing.

first servant.
away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the
plate. good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me,
let the porter let in susan grindstone and nell. antony and potpan!

second servant.
ay, boy, ready.

first servant.
you are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the
great chamber.

second servant.
we cannot be here and there too. cheerly, boys. be brisk awhile, and
the longer liver take all.

 [_exeunt._]

 enter capulet, &c. with the guests and gentlewomen to the maskers.

capulet.
welcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toes
unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you.
ah my mistresses, which of you all
will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
she i’ll swear hath corns. am i come near ye now?
welcome, gentlemen! i have seen the day
that i have worn a visor, and could tell
a whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,
such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,
you are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
a hall, a hall, give room! and foot it, girls.

 [_music plays, and they dance._]

more light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
and quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well.
nay sit, nay sit, good cousin capulet,
for you and i are past our dancing days;
how long is’t now since last yourself and i
were in a mask?

capulet’s cousin.
by’r lady, thirty years.

capulet.
what, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:
’tis since the nuptial of lucentio,
come pentecost as quickly as it will,
some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d.

capulet’s cousin.
’tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir;
his son is thirty.

capulet.
will you tell me that?
his son was but a ward two years ago.

romeo.
what lady is that, which doth enrich the hand
of yonder knight?

servant.
i know not, sir.

romeo.
o, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
as a rich jewel in an ethiop’s ear;
beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
as yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.
the measure done, i’ll watch her place of stand,
and touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
for i ne’er saw true beauty till this night.

tybalt.
this by his voice, should be a montague.
fetch me my rapier, boy. what, dares the slave
come hither, cover’d with an antic face,
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
now by the stock and honour of my kin,
to strike him dead i hold it not a sin.

capulet.
why how now, kinsman!
wherefore storm you so?

tybalt.
uncle, this is a montague, our foe;
a villain that is hither come in spite,
to scorn at our solemnity this night.

capulet.
young romeo, is it?

tybalt.
’tis he, that villain romeo.

capulet.
content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
a bears him like a portly gentleman;
and, to say truth, verona brags of him
to be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth.
i would not for the wealth of all the town
here in my house do him disparagement.
therefore be patient, take no note of him,
it is my will; the which if thou respect,
show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
an ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

tybalt.
it fits when such a villain is a guest:
i’ll not endure him.

capulet.
he shall be endur’d.
what, goodman boy! i say he shall, go to;
am i the master here, or you? go to.
you’ll not endure him! god shall mend my soul,
you’ll make a mutiny among my guests!
you will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!

tybalt.
why, uncle, ’tis a shame.

capulet.
go to, go to!
you are a saucy boy. is’t so, indeed?
this trick may chance to scathe you, i know what.
you must contrary me! marry, ’tis time.
well said, my hearts!—you are a princox; go:
be quiet, or—more light, more light!—for shame!
i’ll make you quiet. what, cheerly, my hearts.

tybalt.
patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
i will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.

 [_exit._]

romeo.
[_to juliet._] if i profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,
my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

juliet.
good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
which mannerly devotion shows in this;
for saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
and palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.

romeo.
have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

juliet.
ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

romeo.
o, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:
they pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

juliet.
saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.

romeo.
then move not while my prayer’s effect i take.
thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d.
[_kissing her._]

juliet.
then have my lips the sin that they have took.

romeo.
sin from my lips? o trespass sweetly urg’d!
give me my sin again.

juliet.
you kiss by the book.

nurse.
madam, your mother craves a word with you.

romeo.
what is her mother?

nurse.
marry, bachelor,
her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
i nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal.
i tell you, he that can lay hold of her
shall have the chinks.

romeo.
is she a capulet?
o dear account! my life is my foe’s debt.

benvolio.
away, be gone; the sport is at the best.

romeo.
ay, so i fear; the more is my unrest.

capulet.
nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,
we have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
is it e’en so? why then, i thank you all;
i thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
more torches here! come on then, let’s to bed.
ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,
i’ll to my rest.

 [_exeunt all but juliet and nurse._]

juliet.
come hither, nurse. what is yond gentleman?

nurse.
the son and heir of old tiberio.

juliet.
what’s he that now is going out of door?

nurse.
marry, that i think be young petruchio.

juliet.
what’s he that follows here, that would not dance?

nurse.
i know not.

juliet.
go ask his name. if he be married,
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

nurse.
his name is romeo, and a montague,
the only son of your great enemy.

juliet.
my only love sprung from my only hate!
too early seen unknown, and known too late!
prodigious birth of love it is to me,
that i must love a loathed enemy.

nurse.
what’s this? what’s this?

juliet.
a rhyme i learn’d even now
of one i danc’d withal.

 [_one calls within, ‘juliet’._]

nurse.
anon, anon!
come let’s away, the strangers all are gone.

act ii


 enter chorus.

chorus.
now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
and young affection gapes to be his heir;
that fair for which love groan’d for and would die,
with tender juliet match’d, is now not fair.
now romeo is belov’d, and loves again,
alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
but to his foe suppos’d he must complain,
and she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
being held a foe, he may not have access
to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
and she as much in love, her means much less
to meet her new beloved anywhere.
but passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

scene i. an open place adjoining capulet’s garden.

 enter romeo.

romeo.
can i go forward when my heart is here?
turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

 [_he climbs the wall and leaps down within it._]

 enter benvolio and mercutio.

benvolio.
romeo! my cousin romeo! romeo!

mercutio.
he is wise,
and on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.

benvolio.
he ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:
call, good mercutio.

mercutio.
nay, i’ll conjure too.
romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,
speak but one rhyme, and i am satisfied;
cry but ‘ah me!’ pronounce but love and dove;
speak to my gossip venus one fair word,
one nickname for her purblind son and heir,
young abraham cupid, he that shot so trim
when king cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.
he heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
the ape is dead, and i must conjure him.
i conjure thee by rosaline’s bright eyes,
by her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
by her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
and the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
that in thy likeness thou appear to us.

benvolio.
an if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

mercutio.
this cannot anger him. ’twould anger him
to raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,
of some strange nature, letting it there stand
till she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;
that were some spite. my invocation
is fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,
i conjure only but to raise up him.

benvolio.
come, he hath hid himself among these trees
to be consorted with the humorous night.
blind is his love, and best befits the dark.

mercutio.
if love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
now will he sit under a medlar tree,
and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
as maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
o romeo, that she were, o that she were
an open-arse and thou a poperin pear!
romeo, good night. i’ll to my truckle-bed.
this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
come, shall we go?

benvolio.
go then; for ’tis in vain
to seek him here that means not to be found.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. capulet’s garden.

 enter romeo.

romeo.
he jests at scars that never felt a wound.

 juliet appears above at a window.

but soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
it is the east, and juliet is the sun!
arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,
who is already sick and pale with grief,
that thou her maid art far more fair than she.
be not her maid since she is envious;
her vestal livery is but sick and green,
and none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
it is my lady, o it is my love!
o, that she knew she were!
she speaks, yet she says nothing. what of that?
her eye discourses, i will answer it.
i am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
having some business, do entreat her eyes
to twinkle in their spheres till they return.
what if her eyes were there, they in her head?
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
as daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
would through the airy region stream so bright
that birds would sing and think it were not night.
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
o that i were a glove upon that hand,
that i might touch that cheek.

juliet.
ay me.

romeo.
she speaks.
o speak again bright angel, for thou art
as glorious to this night, being o’er my head,
as is a winged messenger of heaven
unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
when he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds
and sails upon the bosom of the air.

juliet.
o romeo, romeo, wherefore art thou romeo?
deny thy father and refuse thy name.
or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
and i’ll no longer be a capulet.

romeo.
[_aside._] shall i hear more, or shall i speak at this?

juliet.
’tis but thy name that is my enemy;
thou art thyself, though not a montague.
what’s montague? it is nor hand nor foot,
nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
belonging to a man. o be some other name.
what’s in a name? that which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet;
so romeo would, were he not romeo call’d,
retain that dear perfection which he owes
without that title. romeo, doff thy name,
and for thy name, which is no part of thee,
take all myself.

romeo.
i take thee at thy word.
call me but love, and i’ll be new baptis’d;
henceforth i never will be romeo.

juliet.
what man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night
so stumblest on my counsel?

romeo.
by a name
i know not how to tell thee who i am:
my name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
because it is an enemy to thee.
had i it written, i would tear the word.

juliet.
my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
of thy tongue’s utterance, yet i know the sound.
art thou not romeo, and a montague?

romeo.
neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

juliet.
how cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
and the place death, considering who thou art,
if any of my kinsmen find thee here.

romeo.
with love’s light wings did i o’erperch these walls,
for stony limits cannot hold love out,
and what love can do, that dares love attempt:
therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

juliet.
if they do see thee, they will murder thee.

romeo.
alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
than twenty of their swords. look thou but sweet,
and i am proof against their enmity.

juliet.
i would not for the world they saw thee here.

romeo.
i have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,
and but thou love me, let them find me here.
my life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

juliet.
by whose direction found’st thou out this place?

romeo.
by love, that first did prompt me to enquire;
he lent me counsel, and i lent him eyes.
i am no pilot; yet wert thou as far
as that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,
i should adventure for such merchandise.

juliet.
thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
fain would i dwell on form, fain, fain deny
what i have spoke; but farewell compliment.
dost thou love me? i know thou wilt say ay,
and i will take thy word. yet, if thou swear’st,
thou mayst prove false. at lovers’ perjuries,
they say jove laughs. o gentle romeo,
if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
or if thou thinkest i am too quickly won,
i’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,
so thou wilt woo. but else, not for the world.
in truth, fair montague, i am too fond;
and therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:
but trust me, gentleman, i’ll prove more true
than those that have more cunning to be strange.
i should have been more strange, i must confess,
but that thou overheard’st, ere i was ’ware,
my true-love passion; therefore pardon me,
and not impute this yielding to light love,
which the dark night hath so discovered.

romeo.
lady, by yonder blessed moon i vow,
that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—

juliet.
o swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,
that monthly changes in her circled orb,
lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

romeo.
what shall i swear by?

juliet.
do not swear at all.
or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
which is the god of my idolatry,
and i’ll believe thee.

romeo.
if my heart’s dear love,—

juliet.
well, do not swear. although i joy in thee,
i have no joy of this contract tonight;
it is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,
too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
ere one can say “it lightens.” sweet, good night.
this bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,
may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
good night, good night. as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart as that within my breast.

romeo.
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

juliet.
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

romeo.
th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.

juliet.
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
and yet i would it were to give again.

romeo.
would’st thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

juliet.
but to be frank and give it thee again.
and yet i wish but for the thing i have;
my bounty is as boundless as the sea,
my love as deep; the more i give to thee,
the more i have, for both are infinite.
i hear some noise within. dear love, adieu.
[_nurse calls within._]
anon, good nurse!—sweet montague be true.
stay but a little, i will come again.

 [_exit._]

romeo.
o blessed, blessed night. i am afeard,
being in night, all this is but a dream,
too flattering sweet to be substantial.

 enter juliet above.

juliet.
three words, dear romeo, and good night indeed.
if that thy bent of love be honourable,
thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
by one that i’ll procure to come to thee,
where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
and all my fortunes at thy foot i’ll lay
and follow thee my lord throughout the world.

nurse.
[_within._] madam.

juliet.
i come, anon.— but if thou meanest not well,
i do beseech thee,—

nurse.
[_within._] madam.

juliet.
by and by i come—
to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
tomorrow will i send.

romeo.
so thrive my soul,—

juliet.
a thousand times good night.

 [_exit._]

romeo.
a thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
but love from love, towards school with heavy looks.

 [_retiring slowly._]

 re-enter juliet, above.

juliet.
hist! romeo, hist! o for a falconer’s voice
to lure this tassel-gentle back again.
bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
else would i tear the cave where echo lies,
and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
with repetition of my romeo’s name.

romeo.
it is my soul that calls upon my name.
how silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,
like softest music to attending ears.

juliet.
romeo.

romeo.
my nyas?

juliet.
what o’clock tomorrow
shall i send to thee?

romeo.
by the hour of nine.

juliet.
i will not fail. ’tis twenty years till then.
i have forgot why i did call thee back.

romeo.
let me stand here till thou remember it.

juliet.
i shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
remembering how i love thy company.

romeo.
and i’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,
forgetting any other home but this.

juliet.
’tis almost morning; i would have thee gone,
and yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,
that lets it hop a little from her hand,
like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
and with a silk thread plucks it back again,
so loving-jealous of his liberty.

romeo.
i would i were thy bird.

juliet.
sweet, so would i:
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing.
good night, good night. parting is such sweet sorrow
that i shall say good night till it be morrow.

 [_exit._]

romeo.
sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
would i were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.
hence will i to my ghostly sire’s cell,
his help to crave and my dear hap to tell.

 [_exit._]

scene iii. friar lawrence’s cell.

 enter friar lawrence with a basket.

friar lawrence.
the grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,
chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;
and fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels
from forth day’s pathway, made by titan’s fiery wheels
now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
the day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,
i must upfill this osier cage of ours
with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
the earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;
what is her burying grave, that is her womb:
and from her womb children of divers kind
we sucking on her natural bosom find.
many for many virtues excellent,
none but for some, and yet all different.
o, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
for naught so vile that on the earth doth live
but to the earth some special good doth give;
nor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,
revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
virtue itself turns vice being misapplied,
and vice sometime’s by action dignified.

 enter romeo.

within the infant rind of this weak flower
poison hath residence, and medicine power:
for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
two such opposed kings encamp them still
in man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;
and where the worser is predominant,
full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

romeo.
good morrow, father.

friar lawrence.
benedicite!
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
young son, it argues a distemper’d head
so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,
and where care lodges sleep will never lie;
but where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain
doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
therefore thy earliness doth me assure
thou art uprous’d with some distemperature;
or if not so, then here i hit it right,
our romeo hath not been in bed tonight.

romeo.
that last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

friar lawrence.
god pardon sin. wast thou with rosaline?

romeo.
with rosaline, my ghostly father? no.
i have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.

friar lawrence.
that’s my good son. but where hast thou been then?

romeo.
i’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
i have been feasting with mine enemy,
where on a sudden one hath wounded me
that’s by me wounded. both our remedies
within thy help and holy physic lies.
i bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,
my intercession likewise steads my foe.

friar lawrence.
be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

romeo.
then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set
on the fair daughter of rich capulet.
as mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
and all combin’d, save what thou must combine
by holy marriage. when, and where, and how
we met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,
i’ll tell thee as we pass; but this i pray,
that thou consent to marry us today.

friar lawrence.
holy saint francis! what a change is here!
is rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
so soon forsaken? young men’s love then lies
not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
jesu maria, what a deal of brine
hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for rosaline!
how much salt water thrown away in waste,
to season love, that of it doth not taste.
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.
lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.
if ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
thou and these woes were all for rosaline,
and art thou chang’d? pronounce this sentence then,
women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.

romeo.
thou chidd’st me oft for loving rosaline.

friar lawrence.
for doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

romeo.
and bad’st me bury love.

friar lawrence.
not in a grave
to lay one in, another out to have.

romeo.
i pray thee chide me not, her i love now
doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
the other did not so.

friar lawrence.
o, she knew well
thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
but come young waverer, come go with me,
in one respect i’ll thy assistant be;
for this alliance may so happy prove,
to turn your households’ rancour to pure love.

romeo.
o let us hence; i stand on sudden haste.

friar lawrence.
wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iv. a street.

 enter benvolio and mercutio.

mercutio.
where the devil should this romeo be? came he not home tonight?

benvolio.
not to his father’s; i spoke with his man.

mercutio.
why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that rosaline, torments him so
that he will sure run mad.

benvolio.
tybalt, the kinsman to old capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s
house.

mercutio.
a challenge, on my life.

benvolio.
romeo will answer it.

mercutio.
any man that can write may answer a letter.

benvolio.
nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.

mercutio.
alas poor romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black
eye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart
cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. and is he a man to encounter
tybalt?

benvolio.
why, what is tybalt?

mercutio.
more than prince of cats. o, he’s the courageous captain of
compliments. he fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,
and proportion. he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in
your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;
a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. ah,
the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.

benvolio.
the what?

mercutio.
the pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners
of accent. by jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good
whore. why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should
be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,
these pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot
sit at ease on the old bench? o their bones, their bones!

 enter romeo.

benvolio.
here comes romeo, here comes romeo!

mercutio.
without his roe, like a dried herring. o flesh, flesh, how art thou
fishified! now is he for the numbers that petrarch flowed in. laura, to
his lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to
berhyme her: dido a dowdy; cleopatra a gypsy; helen and hero hildings
and harlots; thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. signior
romeo, bonjour! there’s a french salutation to your french slop. you
gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

romeo.
good morrow to you both. what counterfeit did i give you?

mercutio.
the slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

romeo.
pardon, good mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as
mine a man may strain courtesy.

mercutio.
that’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow
in the hams.

romeo.
meaning, to curtsy.

mercutio.
thou hast most kindly hit it.

romeo.
a most courteous exposition.

mercutio.
nay, i am the very pink of courtesy.

romeo.
pink for flower.

mercutio.
right.

romeo.
why, then is my pump well flowered.

mercutio.
sure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,
that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the
wearing, solely singular.

romeo.
o single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!

mercutio.
come between us, good benvolio; my wits faint.

romeo.
swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or i’ll cry a match.

mercutio.
nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, i am done. for thou hast
more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than i am sure, i have in my
whole five. was i with you there for the goose?

romeo.
thou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the
goose.

mercutio.
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

romeo.
nay, good goose, bite not.

mercutio.
thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.

romeo.
and is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?

mercutio.
o here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an
ell broad.

romeo.
i stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves
thee far and wide a broad goose.

mercutio.
why, is not this better now than groaning for love? now art thou
sociable, now art thou romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as
well as by nature. for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

benvolio.
stop there, stop there.

mercutio.
thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

benvolio.
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

mercutio.
o, thou art deceived; i would have made it short, for i was come to the
whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no
longer.

 enter nurse and peter.

romeo.
here’s goodly gear!
a sail, a sail!

mercutio.
two, two; a shirt and a smock.

nurse.
peter!

peter.
anon.

nurse.
my fan, peter.

mercutio.
good peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.

nurse.
god ye good morrow, gentlemen.

mercutio.
god ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.

nurse.
is it good-den?

mercutio.
’tis no less, i tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the
prick of noon.

nurse.
out upon you! what a man are you?

romeo.
one, gentlewoman, that god hath made for himself to mar.

nurse.
by my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? gentlemen,
can any of you tell me where i may find the young romeo?

romeo.
i can tell you: but young romeo will be older when you have found him
than he was when you sought him. i am the youngest of that name, for
fault of a worse.

nurse.
you say well.

mercutio.
yea, is the worst well? very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.

nurse.
if you be he, sir, i desire some confidence with you.

benvolio.
she will endite him to some supper.

mercutio.
a bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

romeo.
what hast thou found?

mercutio.
no hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something
stale and hoar ere it be spent.
[_sings._]
    an old hare hoar,
    and an old hare hoar,
  is very good meat in lent;
    but a hare that is hoar
    is too much for a score
  when it hoars ere it be spent.
romeo, will you come to your father’s? we’ll to dinner thither.

romeo.
i will follow you.

mercutio.
farewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.

 [_exeunt mercutio and benvolio._]

nurse.
i pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his
ropery?

romeo.
a gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak
more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.

nurse.
and a speak anything against me, i’ll take him down, and a were lustier
than he is, and twenty such jacks. and if i cannot, i’ll find those
that shall. scurvy knave! i am none of his flirt-gills; i am none of
his skains-mates.—and thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to
use me at his pleasure!

peter.
i saw no man use you at his pleasure; if i had, my weapon should
quickly have been out. i warrant you, i dare draw as soon as another
man, if i see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.

nurse.
now, afore god, i am so vexed that every part about me quivers. scurvy
knave. pray you, sir, a word: and as i told you, my young lady bid me
enquire you out; what she bade me say, i will keep to myself. but first
let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they
say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the
gentlewoman is young. and therefore, if you should deal double with
her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and
very weak dealing.

romeo. nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. i protest unto
thee,—

nurse.
good heart, and i’faith i will tell her as much. lord, lord, she will
be a joyful woman.

romeo.
what wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

nurse.
i will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as i take it, is a
gentlemanlike offer.

romeo.
bid her devise
some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
and there she shall at friar lawrence’ cell
be shriv’d and married. here is for thy pains.

nurse.
no truly, sir; not a penny.

romeo.
go to; i say you shall.

nurse.
this afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

romeo.
and stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
within this hour my man shall be with thee,
and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
which to the high topgallant of my joy
must be my convoy in the secret night.
farewell, be trusty, and i’ll quit thy pains;
farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

nurse.
now god in heaven bless thee. hark you, sir.

romeo.
what say’st thou, my dear nurse?

nurse.
is your man secret? did you ne’er hear say,
two may keep counsel, putting one away?

romeo.
i warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.

nurse.
well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. lord, lord! when ’twas a
little prating thing,—o, there is a nobleman in town, one paris, that
would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a
toad, a very toad, as see him. i anger her sometimes, and tell her that
paris is the properer man, but i’ll warrant you, when i say so, she
looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. doth not rosemary and
romeo begin both with a letter?

romeo.
ay, nurse; what of that? both with an r.

nurse.
ah, mocker! that’s the dog’s name. r is for the—no, i know it begins
with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,
of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.

romeo.
commend me to thy lady.

nurse.
ay, a thousand times. peter!

 [_exit romeo._]

peter.
anon.

nurse.
before and apace.

 [_exeunt._]

scene v. capulet’s garden.

 enter juliet.

juliet.
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse,
in half an hour she promised to return.
perchance she cannot meet him. that’s not so.
o, she is lame. love’s heralds should be thoughts,
which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,
driving back shadows over lowering hills:
therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,
and therefore hath the wind-swift cupid wings.
now is the sun upon the highmost hill
of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve
is three long hours, yet she is not come.
had she affections and warm youthful blood,
she’d be as swift in motion as a ball;
my words would bandy her to my sweet love,
and his to me.
but old folks, many feign as they were dead;
unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.

 enter nurse and peter.

o god, she comes. o honey nurse, what news?
hast thou met with him? send thy man away.

nurse.
peter, stay at the gate.

 [_exit peter._]

juliet.
now, good sweet nurse,—o lord, why look’st thou sad?
though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
if good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news
by playing it to me with so sour a face.

nurse.
i am aweary, give me leave awhile;
fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have i had!

juliet.
i would thou hadst my bones, and i thy news:
nay come, i pray thee speak; good, good nurse, speak.

nurse.
jesu, what haste? can you not stay a while? do you not see that i am
out of breath?

juliet.
how art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
to say to me that thou art out of breath?
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay
is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
is thy news good or bad? answer to that;
say either, and i’ll stay the circumstance.
let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?

nurse.
well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.
romeo? no, not he. though his face be better than any man’s, yet his
leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though
they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. he is not the
flower of courtesy, but i’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. go thy
ways, wench, serve god. what, have you dined at home?

juliet.
no, no. but all this did i know before.
what says he of our marriage? what of that?

nurse.
lord, how my head aches! what a head have i!
it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
my back o’ t’other side,—o my back, my back!
beshrew your heart for sending me about
to catch my death with jauncing up and down.

juliet.
i’faith, i am sorry that thou art not well.
sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

nurse.
your love says like an honest gentleman,
and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
and i warrant a virtuous,—where is your mother?

juliet.
where is my mother? why, she is within.
where should she be? how oddly thou repliest.
‘your love says, like an honest gentleman,
‘where is your mother?’

nurse.
o god’s lady dear,
are you so hot? marry, come up, i trow.
is this the poultice for my aching bones?
henceforward do your messages yourself.

juliet.
here’s such a coil. come, what says romeo?

nurse.
have you got leave to go to shrift today?

juliet.
i have.

nurse.
then hie you hence to friar lawrence’ cell;
there stays a husband to make you a wife.
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
they’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
hie you to church. i must another way,
to fetch a ladder by the which your love
must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
i am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
but you shall bear the burden soon at night.
go. i’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

juliet.
hie to high fortune! honest nurse, farewell.

 [_exeunt._]

scene vi. friar lawrence’s cell.

 enter friar lawrence and romeo.

friar lawrence.
so smile the heavens upon this holy act
that after-hours with sorrow chide us not.

romeo.
amen, amen, but come what sorrow can,
it cannot countervail the exchange of joy
that one short minute gives me in her sight.
do thou but close our hands with holy words,
then love-devouring death do what he dare,
it is enough i may but call her mine.

friar lawrence.
these violent delights have violent ends,
and in their triumph die; like fire and powder,
which as they kiss consume. the sweetest honey
is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
and in the taste confounds the appetite.
therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

 enter juliet.

here comes the lady. o, so light a foot
will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.
a lover may bestride the gossamers
that idles in the wanton summer air
and yet not fall; so light is vanity.

juliet.
good even to my ghostly confessor.

friar lawrence.
romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

juliet.
as much to him, else is his thanks too much.

romeo.
ah, juliet, if the measure of thy joy
be heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more
to blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
this neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue
unfold the imagin’d happiness that both
receive in either by this dear encounter.

juliet.
conceit more rich in matter than in words,
brags of his substance, not of ornament.
they are but beggars that can count their worth;
but my true love is grown to such excess,
i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

friar lawrence.
come, come with me, and we will make short work,
for, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
till holy church incorporate two in one.

 [_exeunt._]




act iii

scene i. a public place.


 enter mercutio, benvolio, page and servants.

benvolio.
i pray thee, good mercutio, let’s retire:
the day is hot, the capulets abroad,
and if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
for now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

mercutio.
thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of
a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘god send me no
need of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the
drawer, when indeed there is no need.

benvolio.
am i like such a fellow?

mercutio.
come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in italy; and as
soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.

benvolio.
and what to?

mercutio.
nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would
kill the other. thou? why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a
hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. thou wilt quarrel
with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou
hast hazel eyes. what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy
head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. thou hast
quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. didst thou not fall
out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter? with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? and yet thou wilt
tutor me from quarrelling!

benvolio.
and i were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee
simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

mercutio.
the fee simple! o simple!

 enter tybalt and others.

benvolio.
by my head, here comes the capulets.

mercutio.
by my heel, i care not.

tybalt.
follow me close, for i will speak to them.
gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.

mercutio.
and but one word with one of us? couple it with something; make it a
word and a blow.

tybalt.
you shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me
occasion.

mercutio.
could you not take some occasion without giving?

tybalt.
mercutio, thou consortest with romeo.

mercutio.
consort? what, dost thou make us minstrels? and thou make minstrels of
us, look to hear nothing but discords. here’s my fiddlestick, here’s
that shall make you dance. zounds, consort!

benvolio.
we talk here in the public haunt of men.
either withdraw unto some private place,
and reason coldly of your grievances,
or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

mercutio.
men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
i will not budge for no man’s pleasure, i.

 enter romeo.

tybalt.
well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.

mercutio.
but i’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;
your worship in that sense may call him man.

tybalt.
romeo, the love i bear thee can afford
no better term than this: thou art a villain.

romeo.
tybalt, the reason that i have to love thee
doth much excuse the appertaining rage
to such a greeting. villain am i none;
therefore farewell; i see thou know’st me not.

tybalt.
boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
that thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.

romeo.
i do protest i never injur’d thee,
but love thee better than thou canst devise
till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
and so good capulet, which name i tender
as dearly as mine own, be satisfied.

mercutio.
o calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
[_draws._] alla stoccata carries it away.
tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

tybalt.
what wouldst thou have with me?

mercutio.
good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that i mean to
make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest
of the eight. will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?
make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.

tybalt.
[_drawing._] i am for you.

romeo.
gentle mercutio, put thy rapier up.

mercutio.
come, sir, your passado.

 [_they fight._]

romeo.
draw, benvolio; beat down their weapons.
gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,
tybalt, mercutio, the prince expressly hath
forbid this bandying in verona streets.
hold, tybalt! good mercutio!

 [_exeunt tybalt with his partizans._]

mercutio.
i am hurt.
a plague o’ both your houses. i am sped.
is he gone, and hath nothing?

benvolio.
what, art thou hurt?

mercutio.
ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. marry, ’tis enough.
where is my page? go villain, fetch a surgeon.

 [_exit page._]

romeo.
courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

mercutio.
no, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis
enough, ’twill serve. ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a
grave man. i am peppered, i warrant, for this world. a plague o’ both
your houses. zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to
death. a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
arithmetic!—why the devil came you between us? i was hurt under your
arm.

romeo.
i thought all for the best.

mercutio.
help me into some house, benvolio,
or i shall faint. a plague o’ both your houses.
they have made worms’ meat of me.
i have it, and soundly too. your houses!

 [_exeunt mercutio and benvolio._]

romeo.
this gentleman, the prince’s near ally,
my very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
in my behalf; my reputation stain’d
with tybalt’s slander,—tybalt, that an hour
hath been my cousin. o sweet juliet,
thy beauty hath made me effeminate
and in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.

 re-enter benvolio.

benvolio.
o romeo, romeo, brave mercutio’s dead,
that gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,
which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

romeo.
this day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;
this but begins the woe others must end.

 re-enter tybalt.

benvolio.
here comes the furious tybalt back again.

romeo.
again in triumph, and mercutio slain?
away to heaven respective lenity,
and fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!
now, tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again
that late thou gav’st me, for mercutio’s soul
is but a little way above our heads,
staying for thine to keep him company.
either thou or i, or both, must go with him.

tybalt.
thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
shalt with him hence.

romeo.
this shall determine that.

 [_they fight; tybalt falls._]

benvolio.
romeo, away, be gone!
the citizens are up, and tybalt slain.
stand not amaz’d. the prince will doom thee death
if thou art taken. hence, be gone, away!

romeo.
o, i am fortune’s fool!

benvolio.
why dost thou stay?

 [_exit romeo._]

 enter citizens.

first citizen.
which way ran he that kill’d mercutio?
tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

benvolio.
there lies that tybalt.

first citizen.
up, sir, go with me.
i charge thee in the prince’s name obey.

 enter prince, attended; montague, capulet, their wives and others.

prince.
where are the vile beginners of this fray?

benvolio.
o noble prince, i can discover all
the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
there lies the man, slain by young romeo,
that slew thy kinsman, brave mercutio.

lady capulet.
tybalt, my cousin! o my brother’s child!
o prince! o husband! o, the blood is spill’d
of my dear kinsman! prince, as thou art true,
for blood of ours shed blood of montague.
o cousin, cousin.

prince.
benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

benvolio.
tybalt, here slain, whom romeo’s hand did slay;
romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
how nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal
your high displeasure. all this uttered
with gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d
could not take truce with the unruly spleen
of tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
with piercing steel at bold mercutio’s breast,
who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
and, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
cold death aside, and with the other sends
it back to tybalt, whose dexterity
retorts it. romeo he cries aloud,
‘hold, friends! friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,
his agile arm beats down their fatal points,
and ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
of stout mercutio, and then tybalt fled.
but by and by comes back to romeo,
who had but newly entertain’d revenge,
and to’t they go like lightning; for, ere i
could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain;
and as he fell did romeo turn and fly.
this is the truth, or let benvolio die.

lady capulet.
he is a kinsman to the montague.
affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
and all those twenty could but kill one life.
i beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
romeo slew tybalt, romeo must not live.

prince.
romeo slew him, he slew mercutio.
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

montague.
not romeo, prince, he was mercutio’s friend;
his fault concludes but what the law should end,
the life of tybalt.

prince.
and for that offence
immediately we do exile him hence.
i have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,
my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.
but i’ll amerce you with so strong a fine
that you shall all repent the loss of mine.
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
therefore use none. let romeo hence in haste,
else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
bear hence this body, and attend our will.
mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

 [_exeunt._]

scene ii. a room in capulet’s house.

 enter juliet.

juliet.
gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
towards phoebus’ lodging. such a waggoner
as phaeton would whip you to the west
and bring in cloudy night immediately.
spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
that runaway’s eyes may wink, and romeo
leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.
lovers can see to do their amorous rites
by their own beauties: or, if love be blind,
it best agrees with night. come, civil night,
thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
and learn me how to lose a winning match,
play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,
with thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,
think true love acted simple modesty.
come, night, come romeo; come, thou day in night;
for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,
give me my romeo, and when i shall die,
take him and cut him out in little stars,
and he will make the face of heaven so fine
that all the world will be in love with night,
and pay no worship to the garish sun.
o, i have bought the mansion of a love,
but not possess’d it; and though i am sold,
not yet enjoy’d. so tedious is this day
as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child that hath new robes
and may not wear them. o, here comes my nurse,
and she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
but romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.

 enter nurse, with cords.

now, nurse, what news? what hast thou there?
the cords that romeo bid thee fetch?

nurse.
ay, ay, the cords.

 [_throws them down._]

juliet.
ay me, what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

nurse.
ah, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!
we are undone, lady, we are undone.
alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.

juliet.
can heaven be so envious?

nurse.
romeo can,
though heaven cannot. o romeo, romeo.
who ever would have thought it? romeo!

juliet.
what devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
this torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.
hath romeo slain himself? say thou but ay,
and that bare vowel i shall poison more
than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
i am not i if there be such an i;
or those eyes shut that make thee answer ay.
if he be slain, say ay; or if not, no.
brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

nurse.
i saw the wound, i saw it with mine eyes,
god save the mark!—here on his manly breast.
a piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,
all in gore-blood. i swounded at the sight.

juliet.
o, break, my heart. poor bankrout, break at once.
to prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.
vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,
and thou and romeo press one heavy bier.

nurse.
o tybalt, tybalt, the best friend i had.
o courteous tybalt, honest gentleman!
that ever i should live to see thee dead.

juliet.
what storm is this that blows so contrary?
is romeo slaughter’d and is tybalt dead?
my dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,
for who is living, if those two are gone?

nurse.
tybalt is gone, and romeo banished,
romeo that kill’d him, he is banished.

juliet.
o god! did romeo’s hand shed tybalt’s blood?

nurse.
it did, it did; alas the day, it did.

juliet.
o serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,
dove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
despised substance of divinest show!
just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
a damned saint, an honourable villain!
o nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
in mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
was ever book containing such vile matter
so fairly bound? o, that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace.

nurse.
there’s no trust,
no faith, no honesty in men. all perjur’d,
all forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
ah, where’s my man? give me some aqua vitae.
these griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
shame come to romeo.

juliet.
blister’d be thy tongue
for such a wish! he was not born to shame.
upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;
for ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d
sole monarch of the universal earth.
o, what a beast was i to chide at him!

nurse.
will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?

juliet.
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband?
ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
when i thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?
but wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
that villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,
your tributary drops belong to woe,
which you mistaking offer up to joy.
my husband lives, that tybalt would have slain,
and tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.
all this is comfort; wherefore weep i then?
some word there was, worser than tybalt’s death,
that murder’d me. i would forget it fain,
but o, it presses to my memory
like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.
tybalt is dead, and romeo banished.
that ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’
hath slain ten thousand tybalts. tybalt’s death
was woe enough, if it had ended there.
or if sour woe delights in fellowship,
and needly will be rank’d with other griefs,
why follow’d not, when she said tybalt’s dead,
thy father or thy mother, nay or both,
which modern lamentation might have mov’d?
but with a rear-ward following tybalt’s death,
‘romeo is banished’—to speak that word
is father, mother, tybalt, romeo, juliet,
all slain, all dead. romeo is banished,
there is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
in that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.
where is my father and my mother, nurse?

nurse.
weeping and wailing over tybalt’s corse.
will you go to them? i will bring you thither.

juliet.
wash they his wounds with tears. mine shall be spent,
when theirs are dry, for romeo’s banishment.
take up those cords. poor ropes, you are beguil’d,
both you and i; for romeo is exil’d.
he made you for a highway to my bed,
but i, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
come cords, come nurse, i’ll to my wedding bed,
and death, not romeo, take my maidenhead.

nurse.
hie to your chamber. i’ll find romeo
to comfort you. i wot well where he is.
hark ye, your romeo will be here at night.
i’ll to him, he is hid at lawrence’ cell.

juliet.
o find him, give this ring to my true knight,
and bid him come to take his last farewell.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. friar lawrence’s cell.

 enter friar lawrence.

friar lawrence.
romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts
and thou art wedded to calamity.

 enter romeo.

romeo.
father, what news? what is the prince’s doom?
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
that i yet know not?

friar lawrence.
too familiar
is my dear son with such sour company.
i bring thee tidings of the prince’s doom.

romeo.
what less than doomsday is the prince’s doom?

friar lawrence.
a gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,
not body’s death, but body’s banishment.

romeo.
ha, banishment? be merciful, say death;
for exile hath more terror in his look,
much more than death. do not say banishment.

friar lawrence.
hence from verona art thou banished.
be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

romeo.
there is no world without verona walls,
but purgatory, torture, hell itself.
hence banished is banish’d from the world,
and world’s exile is death. then banished
is death misterm’d. calling death banished,
thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,
and smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

friar lawrence.
o deadly sin, o rude unthankfulness!
thy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince,
taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,
and turn’d that black word death to banishment.
this is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.

romeo.
’tis torture, and not mercy. heaven is here
where juliet lives, and every cat and dog,
and little mouse, every unworthy thing,
live here in heaven and may look on her,
but romeo may not. more validity,
more honourable state, more courtship lives
in carrion flies than romeo. they may seize
on the white wonder of dear juliet’s hand,
and steal immortal blessing from her lips,
who, even in pure and vestal modesty
still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.
but romeo may not, he is banished.
this may flies do, when i from this must fly.
they are free men but i am banished.
and say’st thou yet that exile is not death?
hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,
no sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,
but banished to kill me? banished?
o friar, the damned use that word in hell.
howling attends it. how hast thou the heart,
being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
a sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,
to mangle me with that word banished?

friar lawrence.
thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,

romeo.
o, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

friar lawrence.
i’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,
adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
to comfort thee, though thou art banished.

romeo.
yet banished? hang up philosophy.
unless philosophy can make a juliet,
displant a town, reverse a prince’s doom,
it helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.

friar lawrence.
o, then i see that mad men have no ears.

romeo.
how should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

friar lawrence.
let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

romeo.
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
wert thou as young as i, juliet thy love,
an hour but married, tybalt murdered,
doting like me, and like me banished,
then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
and fall upon the ground as i do now,
taking the measure of an unmade grave.

 [_knocking within._]

friar lawrence.
arise; one knocks. good romeo, hide thyself.

romeo.
not i, unless the breath of heartsick groans
mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.

 [_knocking._]

friar lawrence.
hark, how they knock!—who’s there?—romeo, arise,
thou wilt be taken.—stay awhile.—stand up.

 [_knocking._]

run to my study.—by-and-by.—god’s will,
what simpleness is this.—i come, i come.

 [_knocking._]

who knocks so hard? whence come you, what’s your will?

nurse.
[_within._] let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
i come from lady juliet.

friar lawrence.
welcome then.

 enter nurse.

nurse.
o holy friar, o, tell me, holy friar,
where is my lady’s lord, where’s romeo?

friar lawrence.
there on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

nurse.
o, he is even in my mistress’ case.
just in her case! o woeful sympathy!
piteous predicament. even so lies she,
blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.
for juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
why should you fall into so deep an o?

romeo.
nurse.

nurse.
ah sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.

romeo.
spakest thou of juliet? how is it with her?
doth not she think me an old murderer,
now i have stain’d the childhood of our joy
with blood remov’d but little from her own?
where is she? and how doth she? and what says
my conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?

nurse.
o, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
and now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
and tybalt calls, and then on romeo cries,
and then down falls again.

romeo.
as if that name,
shot from the deadly level of a gun,
did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand
murder’d her kinsman. o, tell me, friar, tell me,
in what vile part of this anatomy
doth my name lodge? tell me, that i may sack
the hateful mansion.

 [_drawing his sword._]

friar lawrence.
hold thy desperate hand.
art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art.
thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
the unreasonable fury of a beast.
unseemly woman in a seeming man,
and ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
thou hast amaz’d me. by my holy order,
i thought thy disposition better temper’d.
hast thou slain tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
and slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,
by doing damned hate upon thyself?
why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?
since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet
in thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
which, like a usurer, abound’st in all,
and usest none in that true use indeed
which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
digressing from the valour of a man;
thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;
thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
misshapen in the conduct of them both,
like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,
is set afire by thine own ignorance,
and thou dismember’d with thine own defence.
what, rouse thee, man. thy juliet is alive,
for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
there art thou happy. tybalt would kill thee,
but thou slew’st tybalt; there art thou happy.
the law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,
and turns it to exile; there art thou happy.
a pack of blessings light upon thy back;
happiness courts thee in her best array;
but like a misshaped and sullen wench,
thou putt’st up thy fortune and thy love.
take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,
ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
but look thou stay not till the watch be set,
for then thou canst not pass to mantua;
where thou shalt live till we can find a time
to blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
than thou went’st forth in lamentation.
go before, nurse. commend me to thy lady,
and bid her hasten all the house to bed,
which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
romeo is coming.

nurse.
o lord, i could have stay’d here all the night
to hear good counsel. o, what learning is!
my lord, i’ll tell my lady you will come.

romeo.
do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

nurse.
here sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

 [_exit._]

romeo.
how well my comfort is reviv’d by this.

friar lawrence.
go hence, good night, and here stands all your state:
either be gone before the watch be set,
or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.
sojourn in mantua. i’ll find out your man,
and he shall signify from time to time
every good hap to you that chances here.
give me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.

romeo.
but that a joy past joy calls out on me,
it were a grief so brief to part with thee.
farewell.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iv. a room in capulet’s house.

 enter capulet, lady capulet and paris.

capulet.
things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
that we have had no time to move our daughter.
look you, she lov’d her kinsman tybalt dearly,
and so did i. well, we were born to die.
’tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.
i promise you, but for your company,
i would have been abed an hour ago.

paris.
these times of woe afford no tune to woo.
madam, good night. commend me to your daughter.

lady capulet.
i will, and know her mind early tomorrow;
tonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.

capulet.
sir paris, i will make a desperate tender
of my child’s love. i think she will be rul’d
in all respects by me; nay more, i doubt it not.
wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
acquaint her here of my son paris’ love,
and bid her, mark you me, on wednesday next,
but, soft, what day is this?

paris.
monday, my lord.

capulet.
monday! ha, ha! well, wednesday is too soon,
a thursday let it be; a thursday, tell her,
she shall be married to this noble earl.
will you be ready? do you like this haste?
we’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,
for, hark you, tybalt being slain so late,
it may be thought we held him carelessly,
being our kinsman, if we revel much.
therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,
and there an end. but what say you to thursday?

paris.
my lord, i would that thursday were tomorrow.

capulet.
well, get you gone. a thursday be it then.
go you to juliet ere you go to bed,
prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
farewell, my lord.—light to my chamber, ho!
afore me, it is so very very late that we
may call it early by and by. good night.

 [_exeunt._]

scene v. an open gallery to juliet’s chamber, overlooking the garden.

 enter romeo and juliet.

juliet.
wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day.
it was the nightingale, and not the lark,
that pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;
nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

romeo.
it was the lark, the herald of the morn,
no nightingale. look, love, what envious streaks
do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day
stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
i must be gone and live, or stay and die.

juliet.
yond light is not daylight, i know it, i.
it is some meteor that the sun exhales
to be to thee this night a torchbearer
and light thee on thy way to mantua.
therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.

romeo.
let me be ta’en, let me be put to death,
i am content, so thou wilt have it so.
i’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,
’tis but the pale reflex of cynthia’s brow.
nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
the vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
i have more care to stay than will to go.
come, death, and welcome. juliet wills it so.
how is’t, my soul? let’s talk. it is not day.

juliet.
it is, it is! hie hence, be gone, away.
it is the lark that sings so out of tune,
straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
some say the lark makes sweet division;
this doth not so, for she divideth us.
some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.
o, now i would they had chang’d voices too,
since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.
o now be gone, more light and light it grows.

romeo.
more light and light, more dark and dark our woes.

 enter nurse.

nurse.
madam.

juliet.
nurse?

nurse.
your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
the day is broke, be wary, look about.

 [_exit._]

juliet.
then, window, let day in, and let life out.

romeo.
farewell, farewell, one kiss, and i’ll descend.

 [_descends._]

juliet.
art thou gone so? love, lord, ay husband, friend,
i must hear from thee every day in the hour,
for in a minute there are many days.
o, by this count i shall be much in years
ere i again behold my romeo.

romeo.
farewell!
i will omit no opportunity
that may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

juliet.
o thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?

romeo.
i doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve
for sweet discourses in our time to come.

juliet.
o god! i have an ill-divining soul!
methinks i see thee, now thou art so low,
as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.

romeo.
and trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
dry sorrow drinks our blood. adieu, adieu.

 [_exit below._]

juliet.
o fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle,
if thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
that is renown’d for faith? be fickle, fortune;
for then, i hope thou wilt not keep him long
but send him back.

lady capulet.
[_within._] ho, daughter, are you up?

juliet.
who is’t that calls? is it my lady mother?
is she not down so late, or up so early?
what unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?

 enter lady capulet.

lady capulet.
why, how now, juliet?

juliet.
madam, i am not well.

lady capulet.
evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?
what, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
and if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,
but much of grief shows still some want of wit.

juliet.
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

lady capulet.
so shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
which you weep for.

juliet.
feeling so the loss,
i cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

lady capulet.
well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death
as that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.

juliet.
what villain, madam?

lady capulet.
that same villain romeo.

juliet.
villain and he be many miles asunder.
god pardon him. i do, with all my heart.
and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

lady capulet.
that is because the traitor murderer lives.

juliet.
ay madam, from the reach of these my hands.
would none but i might venge my cousin’s death.

lady capulet.
we will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
then weep no more. i’ll send to one in mantua,
where that same banish’d runagate doth live,
shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram
that he shall soon keep tybalt company:
and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied.

juliet.
indeed i never shall be satisfied
with romeo till i behold him—dead—
is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.
madam, if you could find out but a man
to bear a poison, i would temper it,
that romeo should upon receipt thereof,
soon sleep in quiet. o, how my heart abhors
to hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,
to wreak the love i bore my cousin
upon his body that hath slaughter’d him.

lady capulet.
find thou the means, and i’ll find such a man.
but now i’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

juliet.
and joy comes well in such a needy time.
what are they, i beseech your ladyship?

lady capulet.
well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
one who to put thee from thy heaviness,
hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
that thou expects not, nor i look’d not for.

juliet.
madam, in happy time, what day is that?

lady capulet.
marry, my child, early next thursday morn
the gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
the county paris, at saint peter’s church,
shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

juliet.
now by saint peter’s church, and peter too,
he shall not make me there a joyful bride.
i wonder at this haste, that i must wed
ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
i pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
i will not marry yet; and when i do, i swear
it shall be romeo, whom you know i hate,
rather than paris. these are news indeed.

lady capulet.
here comes your father, tell him so yourself,
and see how he will take it at your hands.

 enter capulet and nurse.

capulet.
when the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
but for the sunset of my brother’s son
it rains downright.
how now? a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
evermore showering? in one little body
thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
for still thy eyes, which i may call the sea,
do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,
who raging with thy tears and they with them,
without a sudden calm will overset
thy tempest-tossed body. how now, wife?
have you deliver’d to her our decree?

lady capulet.
ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
i would the fool were married to her grave.

capulet.
soft. take me with you, take me with you, wife.
how, will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

juliet.
not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
proud can i never be of what i hate;
but thankful even for hate that is meant love.

capulet.
how now, how now, chopp’d logic? what is this?
proud, and, i thank you, and i thank you not;
and yet not proud. mistress minion you,
thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
but fettle your fine joints ’gainst thursday next
to go with paris to saint peter’s church,
or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
you tallow-face!

lady capulet.
fie, fie! what, are you mad?

juliet.
good father, i beseech you on my knees,
hear me with patience but to speak a word.

capulet.
hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!
i tell thee what,—get thee to church a thursday,
or never after look me in the face.
speak not, reply not, do not answer me.
my fingers itch. wife, we scarce thought us blest
that god had lent us but this only child;
but now i see this one is one too much,
and that we have a curse in having her.
out on her, hilding.

nurse.
god in heaven bless her.
you are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

capulet.
and why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

nurse.
i speak no treason.

capulet.
o god ye good-en!

nurse.
may not one speak?

capulet.
peace, you mumbling fool!
utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,
for here we need it not.

lady capulet.
you are too hot.

capulet.
god’s bread, it makes me mad!
day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,
alone, in company, still my care hath been
to have her match’d, and having now provided
a gentleman of noble parentage,
of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,
stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,
proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,
and then to have a wretched puling fool,
a whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,
to answer, ‘i’ll not wed, i cannot love,
i am too young, i pray you pardon me.’
but, and you will not wed, i’ll pardon you.
graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
look to’t, think on’t, i do not use to jest.
thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.
and you be mine, i’ll give you to my friend;
and you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
for by my soul, i’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,
nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
trust to’t, bethink you, i’ll not be forsworn.

 [_exit._]

juliet.
is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
that sees into the bottom of my grief?
o sweet my mother, cast me not away,
delay this marriage for a month, a week,
or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
in that dim monument where tybalt lies.

lady capulet.
talk not to me, for i’ll not speak a word.
do as thou wilt, for i have done with thee.

 [_exit._]

juliet.
o god! o nurse, how shall this be prevented?
my husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
how shall that faith return again to earth,
unless that husband send it me from heaven
by leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
upon so soft a subject as myself.
what say’st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
some comfort, nurse.

nurse.
faith, here it is.
romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing
that he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.
or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
i think it best you married with the county.
o, he’s a lovely gentleman.
romeo’s a dishclout to him. an eagle, madam,
hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
as paris hath. beshrew my very heart,
i think you are happy in this second match,
for it excels your first: or if it did not,
your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,
as living here and you no use of him.

juliet.
speakest thou from thy heart?

nurse.
and from my soul too,
or else beshrew them both.

juliet.
amen.

nurse.
what?

juliet.
well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
go in, and tell my lady i am gone,
having displeas’d my father, to lawrence’ cell,
to make confession and to be absolv’d.

nurse.
marry, i will; and this is wisely done.

juliet.
ancient damnation! o most wicked fiend!
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
which she hath prais’d him with above compare
so many thousand times? go, counsellor.
thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
i’ll to the friar to know his remedy.
if all else fail, myself have power to die.

act iv

scene i. friar lawrence’s cell.


 enter friar lawrence and paris.

friar lawrence.
on thursday, sir? the time is very short.

paris.
my father capulet will have it so;
and i am nothing slow to slack his haste.

friar lawrence.
you say you do not know the lady’s mind.
uneven is the course; i like it not.

paris.
immoderately she weeps for tybalt’s death,
and therefore have i little talk’d of love;
for venus smiles not in a house of tears.
now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
that she do give her sorrow so much sway;
and in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,
to stop the inundation of her tears,
which, too much minded by herself alone,
may be put from her by society.
now do you know the reason of this haste.

friar lawrence.
[_aside._] i would i knew not why it should be slow’d.—
look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.

 enter juliet.

paris.
happily met, my lady and my wife!

juliet.
that may be, sir, when i may be a wife.

paris.
that may be, must be, love, on thursday next.

juliet.
what must be shall be.

friar lawrence.
that’s a certain text.

paris.
come you to make confession to this father?

juliet.
to answer that, i should confess to you.

paris.
do not deny to him that you love me.

juliet.
i will confess to you that i love him.

paris.
so will ye, i am sure, that you love me.

juliet.
if i do so, it will be of more price,
being spoke behind your back than to your face.

paris.
poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.

juliet.
the tears have got small victory by that;
for it was bad enough before their spite.

paris.
thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.

juliet.
that is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
and what i spake, i spake it to my face.

paris.
thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.

juliet.
it may be so, for it is not mine own.
are you at leisure, holy father, now,
or shall i come to you at evening mass?

friar lawrence.
my leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—
my lord, we must entreat the time alone.

paris.
god shield i should disturb devotion!—
juliet, on thursday early will i rouse ye,
till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

 [_exit._]

juliet.
o shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!

friar lawrence.
o juliet, i already know thy grief;
it strains me past the compass of my wits.
i hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
on thursday next be married to this county.

juliet.
tell me not, friar, that thou hear’st of this,
unless thou tell me how i may prevent it.
if in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
do thou but call my resolution wise,
and with this knife i’ll help it presently.
god join’d my heart and romeo’s, thou our hands;
and ere this hand, by thee to romeo’s seal’d,
shall be the label to another deed,
or my true heart with treacherous revolt
turn to another, this shall slay them both.
therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,
give me some present counsel, or behold
’twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
shall play the empire, arbitrating that
which the commission of thy years and art
could to no issue of true honour bring.
be not so long to speak. i long to die,
if what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.

friar lawrence.
hold, daughter. i do spy a kind of hope,
which craves as desperate an execution
as that is desperate which we would prevent.
if, rather than to marry county paris
thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
then is it likely thou wilt undertake
a thing like death to chide away this shame,
that cop’st with death himself to scape from it.
and if thou dar’st, i’ll give thee remedy.

juliet.
o, bid me leap, rather than marry paris,
from off the battlements of yonder tower,
or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
where serpents are. chain me with roaring bears;
or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,
o’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,
with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.
or bid me go into a new-made grave,
and hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,
and i will do it without fear or doubt,
to live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.

friar lawrence.
hold then. go home, be merry, give consent
to marry paris. wednesday is tomorrow;
tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,
let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
take thou this vial, being then in bed,
and this distilled liquor drink thou off,
when presently through all thy veins shall run
a cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
shall keep his native progress, but surcease.
no warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,
the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
to paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,
like death when he shuts up the day of life.
each part depriv’d of supple government,
shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.
and in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death
thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
and then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
then as the manner of our country is,
in thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,
thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
where all the kindred of the capulets lie.
in the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
shall romeo by my letters know our drift,
and hither shall he come, and he and i
will watch thy waking, and that very night
shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua.
and this shall free thee from this present shame,
if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
abate thy valour in the acting it.

juliet.
give me, give me! o tell not me of fear!

friar lawrence.
hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
in this resolve. i’ll send a friar with speed
to mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

juliet.
love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.
farewell, dear father.

 enter capulet, lady capulet, nurse and servants.

capulet.
so many guests invite as here are writ.

 [_exit first servant._]

sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

second servant.
you shall have none ill, sir; for i’ll try if they can lick their
fingers.

capulet.
how canst thou try them so?

second servant.
marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;
therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.

capulet.
go, begone.

 [_exit second servant._]

we shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.
what, is my daughter gone to friar lawrence?

nurse.
ay, forsooth.

capulet.
well, he may chance to do some good on her.
a peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.

 enter juliet.

nurse.
see where she comes from shrift with merry look.

capulet.
how now, my headstrong. where have you been gadding?

juliet.
where i have learnt me to repent the sin
of disobedient opposition
to you and your behests; and am enjoin’d
by holy lawrence to fall prostrate here,
to beg your pardon. pardon, i beseech you.
henceforward i am ever rul’d by you.

capulet.
send for the county, go tell him of this.
i’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.

juliet.
i met the youthful lord at lawrence’ cell,
and gave him what becomed love i might,
not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.

capulet.
why, i am glad on’t. this is well. stand up.
this is as’t should be. let me see the county.
ay, marry. go, i say, and fetch him hither.
now afore god, this reverend holy friar,
all our whole city is much bound to him.

juliet.
nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
to help me sort such needful ornaments
as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?

lady capulet.
no, not till thursday. there is time enough.

capulet.
go, nurse, go with her. we’ll to church tomorrow.

 [_exeunt juliet and nurse._]

lady capulet.
we shall be short in our provision,
’tis now near night.

capulet.
tush, i will stir about,
and all things shall be well, i warrant thee, wife.
go thou to juliet, help to deck up her.
i’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone.
i’ll play the housewife for this once.—what, ho!—
they are all forth: well, i will walk myself
to county paris, to prepare him up
against tomorrow. my heart is wondrous light
since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.

 [_exeunt._]

scene iii. juliet’s chamber.

 enter juliet and nurse.

juliet.
ay, those attires are best. but, gentle nurse,
i pray thee leave me to myself tonight;
for i have need of many orisons
to move the heavens to smile upon my state,
which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.

 enter lady capulet.

lady capulet.
what, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

juliet.
no, madam; we have cull’d such necessaries
as are behoveful for our state tomorrow.
so please you, let me now be left alone,
and let the nurse this night sit up with you,
for i am sure you have your hands full all
in this so sudden business.

lady capulet.
good night.
get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.

 [_exeunt lady capulet and nurse._]

juliet.
farewell. god knows when we shall meet again.
i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
that almost freezes up the heat of life.
i’ll call them back again to comfort me.
nurse!—what should she do here?
my dismal scene i needs must act alone.
come, vial.
what if this mixture do not work at all?
shall i be married then tomorrow morning?
no, no! this shall forbid it. lie thou there.

 [_laying down her dagger._]

what if it be a poison, which the friar
subtly hath minister’d to have me dead,
lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,
because he married me before to romeo?
i fear it is. and yet methinks it should not,
for he hath still been tried a holy man.
how if, when i am laid into the tomb,
i wake before the time that romeo
come to redeem me? there’s a fearful point!
shall i not then be stifled in the vault,
to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
and there die strangled ere my romeo comes?
or, if i live, is it not very like,
the horrible conceit of death and night,
together with the terror of the place,
as in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
where for this many hundred years the bones
of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,
where bloody tybalt, yet but green in earth,
lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
at some hours in the night spirits resort—
alack, alack, is it not like that i,
so early waking, what with loathsome smells,
and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
that living mortals, hearing them, run mad.
o, if i wake, shall i not be distraught,
environed with all these hideous fears,
and madly play with my forefathers’ joints?
and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud?
and, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,
as with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
o look, methinks i see my cousin’s ghost
seeking out romeo that did spit his body
upon a rapier’s point. stay, tybalt, stay!
romeo, romeo, romeo, here’s drink! i drink to thee.

come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow’d,
the curfew bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock.
look to the bak’d meats, good angelica;
spare not for cost.

nurse.
go, you cot-quean, go,
get you to bed; faith, you’ll be sick tomorrow
for this night’s watching.

capulet.
no, not a whit. what! i have watch’d ere now
all night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.

lady capulet.
ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
but i will watch you from such watching now.

and never trouble peter for the matter.

why, love, i say! madam! sweetheart! why, bride!
what, not a word? you take your pennyworths now.
sleep for a week; for the next night, i warrant,
the county paris hath set up his rest
that you shall rest but little. god forgive me!
marry and amen. how sound is she asleep!
i needs must wake her. madam, madam, madam!
ay, let the county take you in your bed,
he’ll fright you up, i’faith. will it not be?
what, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?
i must needs wake you. lady! lady! lady!
alas, alas! help, help! my lady’s dead!
o, well-a-day that ever i was born.
some aqua vitae, ho! my lord! my lady!

 enter lady capulet.

lady capulet.
what noise is here?

nurse.
o lamentable day!

lady capulet.
what is the matter?

nurse.
look, look! o heavy day!

o me, o me! my child, my only life.
revive, look up, or i will die with thee.
help, help! call help.

 enter capulet.

capulet.
for shame, bring juliet forth, her lord is come.

nurse.
she’s dead, deceas’d, she’s dead; alack the day!

lady capulet.
alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!

capulet.
ha! let me see her. out alas! she’s cold,
her blood is settled and her joints are stiff.
life and these lips have long been separated.
death lies on her like an untimely frost
upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

nurse.
o lamentable day!

lady capulet.
o woful time!

capulet.
death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,
ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.

 enter friar lawrence and paris with musicians.

friar lawrence.
come, is the bride ready to go to church?

capulet.
ready to go, but never to return.
o son, the night before thy wedding day
hath death lain with thy bride. there she lies,
flower as she was, deflowered by him.
death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;
my daughter he hath wedded. i will die
and leave him all; life, living, all is death’s.

paris.
have i thought long to see this morning’s face,
and doth it give me such a sight as this?

lady capulet.
accurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day.
most miserable hour that e’er time saw
in lasting labour of his pilgrimage.
but one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
but one thing to rejoice and solace in,
and cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight.

nurse.
o woe! o woeful, woeful, woeful day.
most lamentable day, most woeful day
that ever, ever, i did yet behold!
o day, o day, o day, o hateful day.
never was seen so black a day as this.
o woeful day, o woeful day.

paris.
beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain.
most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,
by cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.
o love! o life! not life, but love in death!

capulet.
despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.
uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now
to murder, murder our solemnity?
o child! o child! my soul, and not my child,
dead art thou. alack, my child is dead,
and with my child my joys are buried.

friar lawrence.
peace, ho, for shame. confusion’s cure lives not
in these confusions. heaven and yourself
had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,
and all the better is it for the maid.
your part in her you could not keep from death,
but heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
the most you sought was her promotion,
for ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,
and weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d
above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
o, in this love, you love your child so ill
that you run mad, seeing that she is well.
she’s not well married that lives married long,
but she’s best married that dies married young.
dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
on this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
and in her best array bear her to church;
for though fond nature bids us all lament,
yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.

capulet.
all things that we ordained festival
turn from their office to black funeral:
our instruments to melancholy bells,
our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
and all things change them to the contrary.

friar lawrence.
sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
and go, sir paris, everyone prepare
to follow this fair corse unto her grave.
the heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
move them no more by crossing their high will.

will have me live, play ‘heart’s ease.’

first musician.
why ‘heart’s ease’?

o musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘my heart is full’. o play
me some merry dump to comfort me.

first musician.
not a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.

peter.
you will not then?

first musician.
no.

peter.
i will then give it you soundly.

first musician.
what will you give us?

peter.
no money, on my faith, but the gleek! i will give you the minstrel.

first musician.
then will i give you the serving-creature.

peter.
then will i lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. i will
carry no crotchets. i’ll re you, i’ll fa you. do you note me?

first musician.
and you re us and fa us, you note us.

second musician.
pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

peter.
then have at you with my wit. i will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and
put up my iron dagger. answer me like men.
    ‘when griping griefs the heart doth wound,
      and doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    then music with her silver sound’—
why ‘silver sound’? why ‘music with her silver sound’? what say you,
simon catling?

first musician.
marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

peter.
prates. what say you, hugh rebeck?

second musician.
i say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.

peter.
prates too! what say you, james soundpost?

third musician.
faith, i know not what to say.

peter.
o, i cry you mercy, you are the singer. i will say for you. it is
‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold for
sounding.
      ‘then music with her silver sound
      with speedy help doth lend redress.’

scene i. mantua. a street.


 enter romeo.

romeo.
if i may trust the flattering eye of sleep,
my dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
my bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;
and all this day an unaccustom’d spirit
lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—
strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—
and breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,
that i reviv’d, and was an emperor.
ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,
when but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.

 enter balthasar.

news from verona! how now, balthasar?
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
how doth my lady? is my father well?
how fares my juliet? that i ask again;
for nothing can be ill if she be well.

balthasar.
then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
her body sleeps in capel’s monument,
and her immortal part with angels lives.
i saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,
and presently took post to tell it you.
o pardon me for bringing these ill news,
since you did leave it for my office, sir.

romeo.
is it even so? then i defy you, stars!
thou know’st my lodging. get me ink and paper,
and hire post-horses. i will hence tonight.

balthasar.
i do beseech you sir, have patience.
your looks are pale and wild, and do import
some misadventure.

romeo.
tush, thou art deceiv’d.
leave me, and do the thing i bid thee do.
hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

balthasar.
no, my good lord.

romeo.
no matter. get thee gone,
and hire those horses. i’ll be with thee straight.

 [_exit balthasar._]

well, juliet, i will lie with thee tonight.
let’s see for means. o mischief thou art swift
to enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
i do remember an apothecary,—
and hereabouts he dwells,—which late i noted
in tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,
culling of simples, meagre were his looks,
sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
and in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
an alligator stuff’d, and other skins
of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
a beggarly account of empty boxes,
green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.
noting this penury, to myself i said,
and if a man did need a poison now,
whose sale is present death in mantua,
here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
o, this same thought did but forerun my need,
and this same needy man must sell it me.
as i remember, this should be the house.
being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.
what, ho! apothecary!

 enter apothecary.

apothecary.
who calls so loud?

romeo.
come hither, man. i see that thou art poor.
hold, there is forty ducats. let me have
a dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
as will disperse itself through all the veins,
that the life-weary taker may fall dead,
and that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath
as violently as hasty powder fir’d
doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.

apothecary.
such mortal drugs i have, but mantua’s law
is death to any he that utters them.

romeo.
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
and fear’st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.
the world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;
the world affords no law to make thee rich;
then be not poor, but break it and take this.

apothecary.
my poverty, but not my will consents.

romeo.
i pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

apothecary.
put this in any liquid thing you will
and drink it off; and, if you had the strength
of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.

romeo.
there is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,
doing more murder in this loathsome world
than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
i sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
come, cordial and not poison, go with me
to juliet’s grave, for there must i use thee.

friar lawrence.
this same should be the voice of friar john.
welcome from mantua. what says romeo?
or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

friar john.
going to find a barefoot brother out,
one of our order, to associate me,
here in this city visiting the sick,
and finding him, the searchers of the town,
suspecting that we both were in a house
where the infectious pestilence did reign,
seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,
so that my speed to mantua there was stay’d.

friar lawrence.
who bare my letter then to romeo?

friar john.
i could not send it,—here it is again,—
nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
so fearful were they of infection.

friar lawrence.
unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
the letter was not nice, but full of charge,
of dear import, and the neglecting it
may do much danger. friar john, go hence,
get me an iron crow and bring it straight
unto my cell.

friar john.
brother, i’ll go and bring it thee.

 [_exit._]

friar lawrence.
now must i to the monument alone.
within this three hours will fair juliet wake.
she will beshrew me much that romeo
hath had no notice of these accidents;
but i will write again to mantua,
and keep her at my cell till romeo come.

yet put it out, for i would not be seen.
under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
holding thy ear close to the hollow ground;
so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
but thou shalt hear it. whistle then to me,
as signal that thou hear’st something approach.
give me those flowers. do as i bid thee, go.

here in the churchyard; yet i will adventure.

sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed i strew.
o woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,
which with sweet water nightly i will dew,
or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans.
the obsequies that i for thee will keep,
nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.

 [_the page whistles._]

the boy gives warning something doth approach.
what cursed foot wanders this way tonight,
to cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
what, with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.

 [_retires._]

 enter romeo and balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.

romeo.
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
hold, take this letter; early in the morning
see thou deliver it to my lord and father.
give me the light; upon thy life i charge thee,
whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof
and do not interrupt me in my course.
why i descend into this bed of death
is partly to behold my lady’s face,
but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
a precious ring, a ring that i must use
in dear employment. therefore hence, be gone.
but if thou jealous dost return to pry
in what i further shall intend to do,
by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint,
and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
the time and my intents are savage-wild;
more fierce and more inexorable far
than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

balthasar.
i will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

romeo.
so shalt thou show me friendship. take thou that.
live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.

balthasar.
for all this same, i’ll hide me hereabout.
his looks i fear, and his intents i doubt.

 [_retires_]

romeo.
thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,
thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open,

 [_breaking open the door of the monument._]

and in despite, i’ll cram thee with more food.

paris.
this is that banish’d haughty montague
that murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,
it is supposed, the fair creature died,—
and here is come to do some villainous shame
to the dead bodies. i will apprehend him.

 [_advances._]

stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile montague.
can vengeance be pursu’d further than death?
condemned villain, i do apprehend thee.
obey, and go with me, for thou must die.

romeo.
i must indeed; and therefore came i hither.
good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.
fly hence and leave me. think upon these gone;
let them affright thee. i beseech thee, youth,
put not another sin upon my head
by urging me to fury. o be gone.
by heaven i love thee better than myself;
for i come hither arm’d against myself.
stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,
a madman’s mercy bid thee run away.

paris.
i do defy thy conjuration,
and apprehend thee for a felon here.

romeo.
wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

 [_they fight._]

page.
o lord, they fight! i will go call the watch.

 [_exit._]

paris.
o, i am slain! [_falls._] if thou be merciful,
open the tomb, lay me with juliet.

 [_dies._]

romeo.
in faith, i will. let me peruse this face.
mercutio’s kinsman, noble county paris!
what said my man, when my betossed soul
did not attend him as we rode? i think
he told me paris should have married juliet.
said he not so? or did i dream it so?
or am i mad, hearing him talk of juliet,
to think it was so? o, give me thy hand,
one writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.
i’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
a grave? o no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,
for here lies juliet, and her beauty makes
this vault a feasting presence full of light.
death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.

 [_laying paris in the monument._]

how oft when men are at the point of death
have they been merry! which their keepers call
a lightning before death. o, how may i
call this a lightning? o my love, my wife,
death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,
hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
thou art not conquer’d. beauty’s ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
and death’s pale flag is not advanced there.
tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
o, what more favour can i do to thee
than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
to sunder his that was thine enemy?
forgive me, cousin. ah, dear juliet,
why art thou yet so fair? shall i believe
that unsubstantial death is amorous;
and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
thee here in dark to be his paramour?
for fear of that i still will stay with thee,
and never from this palace of dim night
depart again. here, here will i remain
with worms that are thy chambermaids. o, here
will i set up my everlasting rest;
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh. eyes, look your last.
arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, o you
the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
a dateless bargain to engrossing death.
come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.
thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
the dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.
here’s to my love! [_drinks._] o true apothecary!
thy drugs are quick. thus with a kiss i die.

 [_dies._]

 enter, at the other end of the churchyard, friar lawrence, with a
 lantern, crow, and spade.

friar lawrence.
saint francis be my speed. how oft tonight
have my old feet stumbled at graves? who’s there?
who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?

balthasar.
here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

friar lawrence.
bliss be upon you. tell me, good my friend,
what torch is yond that vainly lends his light
to grubs and eyeless skulls? as i discern,
it burneth in the capels’ monument.

balthasar.
it doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,
one that you love.

friar lawrence.
who is it?

balthasar.
romeo.

friar lawrence.
how long hath he been there?

balthasar.
full half an hour.

friar lawrence.
go with me to the vault.

balthasar.
i dare not, sir;
my master knows not but i am gone hence,
and fearfully did menace me with death
if i did stay to look on his intents.

friar lawrence.
stay then, i’ll go alone. fear comes upon me.
o, much i fear some ill unlucky thing.

balthasar.
as i did sleep under this yew tree here,
i dreamt my master and another fought,
and that my master slew him.

friar lawrence.
romeo! [_advances._]
alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
the stony entrance of this sepulchre?
what mean these masterless and gory swords
to lie discolour’d by this place of peace?

 [_enters the monument._]

romeo! o, pale! who else? what, paris too?
and steep’d in blood? ah what an unkind hour
is guilty of this lamentable chance?
the lady stirs.

 [_juliet wakes and stirs._]

juliet.
o comfortable friar, where is my lord?
i do remember well where i should be,
and there i am. where is my romeo?

 [_noise within._]

friar lawrence.
i hear some noise. lady, come from that nest
of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
a greater power than we can contradict
hath thwarted our intents. come, come away.
thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
and paris too. come, i’ll dispose of thee
among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
come, go, good juliet. i dare no longer stay.

juliet.
go, get thee hence, for i will not away.

 [_exit friar lawrence._]

what’s here? a cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?
poison, i see, hath been his timeless end.
o churl. drink all, and left no friendly drop
to help me after? i will kiss thy lips.
haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
to make me die with a restorative.

 [_kisses him._]

thy lips are warm!

first watch.
[_within._] lead, boy. which way?

juliet.
yea, noise? then i’ll be brief. o happy dagger.

 [_snatching romeo’s dagger._]

this is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] there rest, and let me die.

 [_falls on romeo’s body and dies._]

 enter watch with the page of paris.

page.
this is the place. there, where the torch doth burn.

first watch.
the ground is bloody. search about the churchyard.
go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.

 [_exeunt some of the watch._]

pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
and juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
who here hath lain this two days buried.
go tell the prince; run to the capulets.
raise up the montagues, some others search.

 [_exeunt others of the watch._]

we see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
but the true ground of all these piteous woes
we cannot without circumstance descry.

 re-enter some of the watch with balthasar.

second watch.
here’s romeo’s man. we found him in the churchyard.

first watch.
hold him in safety till the prince come hither.

 re-enter others of the watch with friar lawrence.

third watch. here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
we took this mattock and this spade from him
as he was coming from this churchyard side.

first watch.
a great suspicion. stay the friar too.

 enter the prince and attendants.

prince.
what misadventure is so early up,
that calls our person from our morning’s rest?

 enter capulet, lady capulet and others.

capulet.
what should it be that they so shriek abroad?

lady capulet.
o the people in the street cry romeo,
some juliet, and some paris, and all run
with open outcry toward our monument.

prince.
what fear is this which startles in our ears?

first watch.
sovereign, here lies the county paris slain,
and romeo dead, and juliet, dead before,
warm and new kill’d.

prince.
search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

first watch.
here is a friar, and slaughter’d romeo’s man,
with instruments upon them fit to open
these dead men’s tombs.

capulet.
o heaven! o wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
this dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house
is empty on the back of montague,
and it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.

lady capulet.
o me! this sight of death is as a bell
that warns my old age to a sepulchre.

 enter montague and others.

prince.
come, montague, for thou art early up,
to see thy son and heir more early down.

montague.
alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.
what further woe conspires against mine age?

prince.
look, and thou shalt see.

montague.
o thou untaught! what manners is in this,
to press before thy father to a grave?

prince.
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
till we can clear these ambiguities,
and know their spring, their head, their true descent,
and then will i be general of your woes,
and lead you even to death. meantime forbear,
and let mischance be slave to patience.
bring forth the parties of suspicion.

friar lawrence.
i am the greatest, able to do least,
yet most suspected, as the time and place
doth make against me, of this direful murder.
and here i stand, both to impeach and purge
myself condemned and myself excus’d.

prince.
then say at once what thou dost know in this.

friar lawrence.
i will be brief, for my short date of breath
is not so long as is a tedious tale.
romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet,
and she, there dead, that romeo’s faithful wife.
i married them; and their stol’n marriage day
was tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death
banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;
for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pin’d.
you, to remove that siege of grief from her,
betroth’d, and would have married her perforce
to county paris. then comes she to me,
and with wild looks, bid me devise some means
to rid her from this second marriage,
or in my cell there would she kill herself.
then gave i her, so tutored by my art,
a sleeping potion, which so took effect
as i intended, for it wrought on her
the form of death. meantime i writ to romeo
that he should hither come as this dire night
to help to take her from her borrow’d grave,
being the time the potion’s force should cease.
but he which bore my letter, friar john,
was stay’d by accident; and yesternight
return’d my letter back. then all alone
at the prefixed hour of her waking
came i to take her from her kindred’s vault,
meaning to keep her closely at my cell
till i conveniently could send to romeo.
but when i came, some minute ere the time
of her awaking, here untimely lay
the noble paris and true romeo dead.
she wakes; and i entreated her come forth
and bear this work of heaven with patience.
but then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
and she, too desperate, would not go with me,
but, as it seems, did violence on herself.
all this i know; and to the marriage
her nurse is privy. and if ought in this
miscarried by my fault, let my old life
be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,
unto the rigour of severest law.

prince.
we still have known thee for a holy man.
where’s romeo’s man? what can he say to this?

balthasar.
i brought my master news of juliet’s death,
and then in post he came from mantua
to this same place, to this same monument.
this letter he early bid me give his father,
and threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,
if i departed not, and left him there.

prince.
give me the letter, i will look on it.
where is the county’s page that rais’d the watch?
sirrah, what made your master in this place?

page.
he came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,
and bid me stand aloof, and so i did.
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
and by and by my master drew on him,
and then i ran away to call the watch.

prince.
this letter doth make good the friar’s words,
their course of love, the tidings of her death.
and here he writes that he did buy a poison
of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal
came to this vault to die, and lie with juliet.
where be these enemies? capulet, montague,
see what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
and i, for winking at your discords too,
have lost a brace of kinsmen. all are punish’d.

capulet.
o brother montague, give me thy hand.
this is my daughter’s jointure, for no more
can i demand.

montague.
but i can give thee more,
for i will raise her statue in pure gold,
that whiles verona by that name is known,
there shall no figure at such rate be set
as that of true and faithful juliet.

capulet.
as rich shall romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
poor sacrifices of our enmity.

prince.
a glooming peace this morning with it brings;
the sun for sorrow will not show his head.
go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.
some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,
for never was a story of more woe
than this of juliet and her romeo.

 [_exeunt._]

section 4. information about donations to the project gutenberg
literary archive foundation

project gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states. compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. to send
donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states. u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.

please check the project gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. to

preface.

[illustration]


_walt whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving
by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” this distinction applies
to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it
brings a curious consequence with it. there is much more difference as
to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by
allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and
proper thing to love them. and in the sect--fairly large and yet
unusually choice--of austenians or janites, there would probably be
found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the
novels. to some the delightful freshness and humour of_ northanger
abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted
critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with
difficulty._ persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite
delicacy and keeping. the catastrophe of_ mansfield park _is admittedly
theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost
wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that
edmund only took fanny because mary shocked him, and that fanny might
very likely have taken crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;
yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of mrs. norris and
others have secured, i believe, a considerable party for it._ sense and
sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
not want them._

_i suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes
would, all things considered, be divided between_ emma _and the present
book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for miss
austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge
of vulgarity) would go for_ emma. _it is the larger, the more varied, the
more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather
more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most
peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as miss bates, as the
eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. on the other hand,
i, for my part, declare for_ pride and prejudice _unhesitatingly. it
seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most
eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention
in such narrow space as is permitted to me, i propose here to show
cause._

_in the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the
reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,
when miss austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and
finished at chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till
1813, only four years before her death. i do not know whether, in this
combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the
critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct
superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it
possesses over all the others. the plot, though not elaborate, is almost
regular enough for fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident
could be retrenched without loss to the story. the elopement of lydia
and wickham is not, like that of crawford and mrs. rushworth, a_ coup de
théâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the
story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.
all the minor passages--the loves of jane and bingley, the advent of mr.
collins, the visit to hunsford, the derbyshire tour--fit in after the
same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. there is no attempt at the
hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between
frank churchill and jane fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the
intrigue of_ emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which i do not think
the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. although miss austen
always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her
opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to
be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly
natural occasions provided by the false account of darcy’s conduct given
by wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from
the gradual transformation of elizabeth’s own feelings from positive
aversion to actual love. i do not know whether the all-grasping hand of
the playwright has ever been laid upon_ pride and prejudice; _and i dare
say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or
garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and
delicate for pit and gallery. but if the attempt were made, it would
certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,
which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can
avail himself, appear at once on the stage._

_i think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to
more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest
merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. it sets off his other gifts
and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it
will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite
consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. but a very badly-built
novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which
displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all
faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot
acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. and despite the
ability which miss austen has shown in working out the story, i for one
should put_ pride and prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what
seem to me the very masterpieces of miss austen’s humour and of her
faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit john
thorpe, the eltons, mrs. norris, and one or two others to their company,
but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still
superior to them._

_the characteristics of miss austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate
that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to
express, and at any particular time likely to be differently
apprehended by different persons. to me this humour seems to possess a
greater affinity, on the whole, to that of addison than to any other of
the numerous species of this great british genus. the differences of
scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,
obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,
for there was a distinctly feminine element in “mr. spectator,” and in
jane austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was
masculine. but the likeness of quality consists in a great number of
common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,
avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. also there is in both a
certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. it is the custom with those
who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of addison with the
savagery of swift, the mildness of miss austen with the boisterousness
of fielding and smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that
her immediate predecessor, miss burney, allowed without very much
protest. yet, both in mr. addison and in miss austen there is, though a
restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in
roasting and cutting up a fool. a man in the early eighteenth century,
of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early
nineteenth; and no doubt miss austen’s principles, as well as her heart,
would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate
husband in the_ spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the
innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play
at blind-man’s-buff. but another_ spectator _letter--that of the damsel
of fourteen who wishes to marry mr. shapely, and assures her selected
mentor that “he admires your_ spectators _mightily”--might have been
written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent lydia bennet in the
days of lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (i
think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of miss austen’s
own, such as her satire of mrs. musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over
her son. but this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the
english language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous
falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and
snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. if cynicism means
the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells
beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and
that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then
every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a
fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is
a cynic. and in that sense miss austen certainly was one. she may even
have been one in the further sense that, like her own mr. bennet, she
took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at
work her fools and her mean persons. i think she did take this delight,
and i do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she
was immensely the better for it as an artist._

_in respect of her art generally, mr. goldwin smith has truly observed
that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,
combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that
we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature
painter. to make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the
term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of memling
at one end of the history of painting and meissonier at the other, than
of cosway or any of his kind. and i am not so certain that i should
myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. if her world is a
microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the
littleness. she does not touch what she did not feel herself called to
paint; i am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not
feel herself called to touch. it is at least remarkable that in two very
short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not
much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a
single failure. it is possible that the romantic paste in her
composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly
anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century
seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. even scott
required hill and mountain and ballad, even coleridge metaphysics and
german to enable them to chip the classical shell. miss austen was an
english girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when
ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might
pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the
gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were
subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which
mary wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular
taste or judgment. miss austen, too, drew back when the white frost
touched her shoes; but i think she would have made a pretty good journey
even in a black one._

_for if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which
only genius knows. the one was humanity, and the other was art. on the
first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are
true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” as to art, if she
has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes
the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. take almost any
frenchman, except the late m. de maupassant, and watch him laboriously
piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. you get
none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can
shape a real impression out of the rest. but with miss austen the
myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.
nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. when (to take the present book
only) mr. collins changed his mind from jane to elizabeth “while mrs.
bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _mrs. bennet would have
stirred the fire), when mr. darcy “brought his coffee-cup back_
himself,” _the touch in each case is like that of swift--“taller by the
breadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant thackeray with
just and outspoken admiration. indeed, fantastic as it may seem, i
should put miss austen as near to swift in some ways, as i have put her
to addison in others._

_this swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears
nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable mr.
collins. mr. collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything addison
ever did, almost great enough for fielding or for swift himself. it has
been said that no one ever was like him. but in the first place,_ he
_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds
of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and
distinguished philosophers.” in the second place, it is rash, i think,
to conclude that an actual mr. collins was impossible or non-existent at
the end of the eighteenth century. it is very interesting that we
possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first
draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in john dashwood. the
formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait
is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. mr.
collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. in fact, for all the
“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain
side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century
humanity, its philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,
its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,
its selfishness, receives exhibition. i will not admit that one speech
or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled
with reality, and i should not wonder if many of these words and actions
are historically true._

_but the greatness of mr. collins could not have been so satisfactorily
exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the
figures of mr. bennet and of lady catherine de bourgh. the latter, like
mr. collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. there is,
perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me
very faint indeed. even now i do not think that it would be impossible
to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble
birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,
as lady catherine. a hundred years ago, an earl’s daughter, the lady
powerful (if not exactly bountiful) of an out-of-the-way country parish,
rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of
developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present
themselves now. as for mr. bennet, miss austen, and mr. darcy, and even
miss elizabeth herself, were, i am inclined to think, rather hard on him
for the “impropriety” of his conduct. his wife was evidently, and must
always have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her
or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but
the ironic. from no other point of view is he open to any reproach,
except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of
the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the
consciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that
even miss austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. it is
difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,
or when putting mr. collins through his paces; but the general sense of
the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his
consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, “my dear,
do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. let us hope for better things.
let us flatter ourselves that_ i _may be the survivor;” and his inquiry
to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which mr. collins has just
related as made by himself to lady catherine, “may i ask whether these
pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the
result of previous study?” these are the things which give miss austen’s
readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by
the readers of swift, of fielding, and we may here add, of thackeray, as
they are felt by the readers of no other english author of fiction
outside of these four._

_the goodness of the minor characters in_ pride and prejudice _has been
already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties
difficult in any space, and impossible in this. mrs. bennet we have
glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely
amusing or more horribly true. much the same may be said of kitty and
lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have
differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and
vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common
weaknesses of woman at such different ages. with mary, miss austen has
taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;
not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting
traditional appendices which mr. austen leigh has given us, in dooming
her privately to marry “one of mr. philips’s clerks.” the habits of
first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and
singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but
perhaps poor mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings
in that fordyce-belectured generation. it is at any rate difficult not
to extend to her a share of the respect and affection (affection and
respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless), with which one regards mr.
collins, when she draws the moral of lydia’s fall. i sometimes wish
that the exigencies of the story had permitted miss austen to unite
these personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe
poor mrs. bennet’s anguish over the entail._

_the bingleys and the gardiners and the lucases, miss darcy and miss de
bourgh, jane, wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,
further than the remark that charlotte lucas (her egregious papa, though
delightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between
comedy and farce) is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and
that wickham (though something of miss austen’s hesitation of touch in
dealing with young men appears) is a not much less notable sketch in
drab of another. only genius could have made charlotte what she is, yet
not disagreeable; wickham what he is, without investing him either with
a cheap don juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. but the
hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed._

_darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of
miss austen’s heroes; the only possible competitor being henry tilney,
whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into
comparison. it has sometimes, i believe, been urged that his pride is
unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while
his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. here again i
cannot go with the objectors. darcy’s own account of the way in which
his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and
nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a_ causa verior _for its
sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of elizabeth’s
scornful refusal acting on a nature_ ex hypothesi _generous. nothing in
even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of
his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of pemberley. had he
been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting
under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come
husband-hunting. his being neither is exactly consistent with the
probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really
injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. as for his being in
love, elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that
phenomenon as darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,
only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal
charm._

_the secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from miss austen
herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather
to be felt than to be explained. elizabeth of course belongs to the_
allegro _or_ allegra _division of the army of venus. miss austen was
always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and
except the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate
sometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing
about her looks. but her chief difference from other heroines of the
lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost
strong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and
secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her
propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. elizabeth can give
at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never
“scratches,” and she never attacks first. some of the merest
obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early
speeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to
serious business, as in the great proposal scene with darcy (which is,
as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book), and in the
final ladies’ battle with lady catherine, she is unexceptionable. then
too she is a perfectly natural girl. she does not disguise from herself
or anybody that she resents darcy’s first ill-mannered personality with
as personal a feeling. (by the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of
this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same
kind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have
been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons
who ought to have been no worse bred than darcy.) and she lets the
injury done to jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family
aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world._

_still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a
common form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her
playfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a
certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.
nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent
darcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the
idea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating wickham.
elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing_ viraginous, _nothing of the
“new woman” about her, has by nature what the best modern (not “new”)
women have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea
that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with
her if they can. though not in the least “impudent and mannish grown,”
she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. the form of
passion common and likely to seem natural in miss austen’s day was so
invariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of
these qualities, that she has not made elizabeth outwardly passionate.
but i, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have
married darcy just as willingly without pemberley as with it, and
anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers’
conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked
to the della cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the della
cruscans of this._

_and, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of
charm?--it is there. there were better sense in the sad mechanic
exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. in
the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young
ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at
least five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can
help doing so. their names are, in chronological order, elizabeth
bennet, diana vernon, argemone lavington, beatrix esmond, and barbara

[illustration: ·pride and prejudice·




chapter i.]


it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.

however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.

“my dear mr. bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last?”

mr. bennet replied that he had not.

“but it is,” returned she; “for mrs. long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.”

mr. bennet made no answer.

“do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.

“_you_ want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it.”

[illustration:

“he came down to see the place”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

this was invitation enough.

“why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week.”

“what is his name?”

“bingley.”

“is he married or single?”

“oh, single, my dear, to be sure! a single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year. what a fine thing for our girls!”

“how so? how can it affect them?”

“my dear mr. bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them.”

“is that his design in settling here?”

“design? nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.”

“i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go--or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are
as handsome as any of them, mr. bingley might like you the best of the
party.”

“my dear, you flatter me. i certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. when a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”

“in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”

“but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood.”

“it is more than i engage for, i assure you.”

“but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new
comers. indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit
him, if you do not.”

“you are over scrupulous, surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be very
glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy.”

“i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not a bit better than the
others: and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so
good-humoured as lydia. but you are always giving _her_ the preference.”

“they have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.”

“mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? you take
delight in vexing me. you have no compassion on my poor nerves.”

“you mistake me, my dear. i have a high respect for your nerves. they
are my old friends. i have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least.”

“ah, you do not know what i suffer.”

“but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”

“it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visit them.”

“depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them
all.”

mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _her_ mind
was less difficult to develope. she was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. when she was discontented, she
fancied herself nervous. the business of her life was to get her
daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.

chapter ii.


[illustration]

mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley. he
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it. it was then disclosed in the following
manner. observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,--

“i hope mr. bingley will like it, lizzy.”

“we are not in a way to know _what_ mr. bingley likes,” said her mother,
resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”

“but you forget, mamma,” said elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him.”

“i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing. she has two nieces
of her own. she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion
of her.”

“no more have i,” said mr. bennet; “and i am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you.”

mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

“don’t keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven’s sake! have a little
compassion on my nerves. you tear them to pieces.”

“kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
them ill.”

“i do not cough for my own amusement,” replied kitty, fretfully. “when
is your next ball to be, lizzy?”

“to-morrow fortnight.”

“ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and mrs. long does not come back till
the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for
she will not know him herself.”

“then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
mr. bingley to _her_.”

“impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teasing?”

“i honour your circumspection. a fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly
very little. one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight. but if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,
as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i
will take it on myself.”

the girls stared at their father. mrs. bennet said only, “nonsense,
nonsense!”

“what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you _there_. what say you,
mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection, i know, and read
great books, and make extracts.”

mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.

“while mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to mr.
bingley.”

“i am sick of mr. bingley,” cried his wife.

“i am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? if i
had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on
him. it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now.”

the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of mrs.
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.

“how good it was in you, my dear mr. bennet! but i knew i should
persuade you at last. i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. well, how pleased i am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a
word about it till now.”

“now, kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said mr. bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

“what an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was
shut. “i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter. at our time of life, it is not so
pleasant, i can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes we would do anything. lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.”

“oh,” said lydia, stoutly, “i am not afraid; for though i _am_ the
youngest, i’m the tallest.”

the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return mr. bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.

chapter iii.

not all that mrs. bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley. they attacked him
in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
lady lucas. her report was highly favourable. sir william had been
delighted with him. he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. nothing could be more delightful! to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of mr. bingley’s heart were entertained.

“if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield,”
said mrs. bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
married, i shall have nothing to wish for.”

in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet’s visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library. he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father. the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.

an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had
mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. mr. bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, etc. mrs. bennet was quite
disconcerted. she could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at netherfield as he ought to be. lady lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his

being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball; and a
report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and
seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. the girls grieved over such a
number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing
that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from london,
his five sisters and a cousin. and when the party entered the
assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: mr. bingley, his
two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.

mr. bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. his sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. his brother-in-law, mr. hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. the gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than mr. bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,
disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his
friend.

mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at netherfield. such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. what a contrast between him and his friend! mr. darcy danced
only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
his character was decided. he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters.

elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr. darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
mr. bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his
friend to join it.

“come, darcy,” said he, “i must have you dance. i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. you had much better
dance.”

“i certainly shall not. you know how i detest it, unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner. at such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable. your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with.”

“i would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried bingley, “for a
kingdom! upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life as i have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,
uncommonly pretty.”

“_you_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said mr.
darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.

“oh, she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i
dare say very agreeable. do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”

[illustration:

“she is tolerable”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

“which do you mean?” and turning round, he looked for a moment at
elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,
“she is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; and i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”

mr. bingley followed his advice. mr. darcy walked off; and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. she told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.

the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. mrs.
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
party. mr. bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters. jane was as much gratified by this as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way. elizabeth felt jane’s
pleasure. mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. they returned, therefore, in good
spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. they found mr. bennet still up. with a
book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. he had rather hoped that all his wife’s
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.

“oh, my dear mr. bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. i wish you had been there.
jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. everybody said how well
she looked; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice. only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. first of all, he asked miss lucas. i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance. so he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. then, the two third he danced with miss
king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane
again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the _boulanger_----”

“if he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,
“he would not have danced half so much! for god’s sake, say no more of
his partners. o that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!”

“oh, my dear,” continued mrs. bennet, “i am quite delighted with him. he
is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. i never
in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. i dare say the
lace upon mrs. hurst’s gown----”

here she was interrupted again. mr. bennet protested against any
description of finery. she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy.

“but i can assure you,” she added, “that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. so high and so conceited, that there was no enduring
him! he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! not handsome enough to dance with! i wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. i quite detest the man.”

chapter iv.


[illustration]

when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of mr. bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.

“he is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners! so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!”

“he is also handsome,” replied elizabeth, “which a young man ought
likewise to be if he possibly can. his character is thereby complete.”

“i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. i
did not expect such a compliment.”

“did not you? _i_ did for you. but that is one great difference between
us. compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. what
could be more natural than his asking you again? he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room. no thanks to his gallantry for that. well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him. you have liked many a
stupider person.”

“dear lizzy!”

“oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
you never see a fault in anybody. all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes. i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”

“i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but i always speak
what i think.”

“i know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. with _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it
everywhere. but to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the
good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad,--belongs to you alone. and so, you like this man’s sisters,
too, do you? their manners are not equal to his.”

“certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. miss bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her.”

elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was
very little disposed to approve them. they were, in fact, very fine
ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.
they were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves and meanly of others. they were of a respectable family in
the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.

mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it. mr. bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.

his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was mrs. hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her. mr. bingley had not been of
age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to
look at netherfield house. he did look at it, and into it, for half an
hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.

between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character. bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied. on the strength of darcy’s regard, bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. in
understanding, darcy was the superior. bingley was by no means
deficient; but darcy was clever. he was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not
inviting. in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; darcy was continually
giving offence.

the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;
there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful. darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure. miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too
much.

mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of. miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.

chapter v.


[illustration]

within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets
were particularly intimate. sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. the
distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. it had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;
and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about
a mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge; where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. for,
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to everybody. by nature inoffensive,
friendly, and obliging, his presentation at st. james’s had made him
courteous.

lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet. they had several children. the eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
elizabeth’s intimate friend.

that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.

“_you_ began the evening well, charlotte,” said mrs. bennet, with civil
self-command, to miss lucas. “_you_ were mr. bingley’s first choice.”

“yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”

“oh, you mean jane, i suppose, because he danced with her twice. to be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, i rather believe he
_did_--i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something
about mr. robinson.”

“perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson: did not
i mention it to you? mr. robinson’s asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question, ‘oh, the eldest miss bennet,
beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”

“upon my word! well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”

“_my_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, eliza,” said
charlotte. “mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he? poor eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.”

“i beg you will not put it into lizzy’s head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him. mrs. long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.”

[illustration: “without once opening his lips”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

“are you quite sure, ma’am? is not there a little mistake?” said jane.
“i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her.”

“ay, because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being
spoke to.”

“miss bingley told me,” said jane, “that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance. with _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable.”

“i do not believe a word of it, my dear. if he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked to mrs. long. but i can guess how it
was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and i dare say he had
heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage, and had to come
to the ball in a hack chaise.”

“i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long,” said miss lucas, “but i
wish he had danced with eliza.”

“another time, lizzy,” said her mother, “i would not dance with _him_,
if i were you.”

“i believe, ma’am, i may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”

“his pride,” said miss lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. if i may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud.”

“that is very true,” replied elizabeth, “and i could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”

“pride,” observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, “is a very common failing, i believe. by all that i have
ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. a person may be
proud without being vain. pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.”

“if i were as rich as mr. darcy,” cried a young lucas, who came with his
sisters, “i should not care how proud i was. i would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.”

“then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said mrs.
bennet; “and if i were to see you at it, i should take away your bottle
directly.”

the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would; and the argument ended only with the visit.

chapter vi.


[illustration]

the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. the visit
was returned in due form. miss bennet’s pleasing manners grew on the
good-will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards the
two eldest. by jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,
in all probability, from the influence of their brother’s admiration. it
was generally evident, whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and
to _her_ it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent. she mentioned this to her friend, miss
lucas.

“it may, perhaps, be pleasant,” replied charlotte, “to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark. there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. we can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_
affection than she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”

“but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. if _i_ can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too.”

“remember, eliza, that he does not know jane’s disposition as you do.”

“but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal
it, he must find it out.”

“perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together. jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention. when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chooses.”

“your plan is a good one,” replied elizabeth, “where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it. but
these are not jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. as yet she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness. she has known him only a fortnight. she danced four
dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times. this is not quite
enough to make her understand his character.”

“not as you represent it. had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal.”

“yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like vingt-un better than commerce, but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”

“well,” said charlotte, “i wish jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth. happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life.”

“you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound. you know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”

occupied in observing mr. bingley’s attention to her sister, elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. mr. darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. of
this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.

he began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. his doing so
drew her notice. it was at sir william lucas’s, where a large party were
assembled.

“what does mr. darcy mean,” said she to charlotte, “by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster?”

“that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer.”

“but if he does it any more, i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he is about. he has a very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him.”

[illustration: “the entreaties of several” [_copyright 1894 by george
allen._]]

on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,--

“did not you think, mr. darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton?”

“with great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic.”

“you are severe on us.”

“it will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said miss lucas. “i am going
to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows.”

“you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! if my vanity had taken a
musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers.” on miss lucas’s persevering, however,
she added, “very well; if it must be so, it must.” and gravely glancing
at mr. darcy, “there is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is
of course familiar with--‘keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and
i shall keep mine to swell my song.”

her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. after a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.

mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached. elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.

mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas
was his neighbour, till sir william thus began:--

“what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr. darcy! there is
nothing like dancing, after all. i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies.”

“certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”

sir william only smiled. “your friend performs delightfully,” he
continued, after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group; “and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr. darcy.”

“you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir.”

“yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. do
you often dance at st. james’s?”

“never, sir.”

“do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”

“it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it.”

“you have a house in town, i conclude?”

mr. darcy bowed.

“i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for i am fond of
superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
london would agree with lady lucas.”

he paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,--

“my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing? mr. darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. you
cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”
and, taking her hand, he would have given it to mr. darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william,--

“indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing. i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”

mr. darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand, but in vain. elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

“you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour.”

“mr. darcy is all politeness,” said elizabeth, smiling.

“he is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?”

elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. her resistance had not injured
her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley,--

“i can guess the subject of your reverie.”

“i should imagine not.”

“you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, i am quite of
your opinion. i was never more annoyed! the insipidity, and yet the
noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these
people! what would i give to hear your strictures on them!”

“your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you. my mind was more
agreeably engaged. i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”

miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
mr. darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--

“miss elizabeth bennet.”

“miss elizabeth bennet!” repeated miss bingley. “i am all astonishment.
how long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am i to wish you
joy?”

“that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask. a lady’s
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. i knew you would be wishing me joy.”

“nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled. you will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at pemberley with you.”

he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed along.

     “a note for miss bennet”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]




chapter vii.


[illustration]

mr. bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his. her father had been an attorney in meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.

she had a sister married to a mr. philips, who had been a clerk to their
father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
london in a respectable line of trade.

the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and
to a milliner’s shop just over the way. the two youngest of the family,
catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:
their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing
better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of
news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn
some from their aunt. at present, indeed, they were well supplied both
with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in
the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was
the head-quarters.

their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence. every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers’ names and connections. their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves. mr. philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before. they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr.
bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.

after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr.
bennet coolly observed,--

“from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country. i have suspected it some time, but
i am now convinced.”

catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to london.

“i am astonished, my dear,” said mrs. bennet, “that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. if i wished to think slightingly
of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”

“if my children are silly, i must hope to be always sensible of it.”

“yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”

“this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree. i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.”

“my dear mr. bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. when they get to our age, i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do. i remember the time when i
liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so i do still at my
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought
colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william’s in
his regimentals.”

“mamma,” cried lydia, “my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watson’s as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke’s library.”

mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer. mrs. bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--

“well, jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? well,
jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”

“it is from miss bingley,” said jane, and then read it aloud.

     /* nind “my dear friend, */

     “if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and
     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never
     end without a quarrel. come as soon as you can on the receipt of
     this. my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
     yours ever,

“caroline bingley.”

“with the officers!” cried lydia: “i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_.”

“dining out,” said mrs. bennet; “that is very unlucky.”

“can i have the carriage?” said jane.

“no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night.”

“that would be a good scheme,” said elizabeth, “if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home.”

“oh, but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley’s chaise to go to meryton;
and the hursts have no horses to theirs.”

“i had much rather go in the coach.”

“but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure. they are
wanted in the farm, mr. bennet, are not they?”

[illustration: cheerful prognostics]

“they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them.”

“but if you have got them to-day,” said elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose
will be answered.”

she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged; jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day. her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard. her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. the rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
jane certainly could not come back.

“this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said mrs. bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
brought the following note for elizabeth:--

     /* nind “my dearest lizzie, */

     “i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be
     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. my kind friends will
     not hear of my returning home till i am better. they insist also on
     my seeing mr. jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a
     headache, there is not much the matter with me.

“yours, etc.”

“well, my dear,” said mr. bennet, when elizabeth had read the note
aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr. bingley, and under your orders.”

“oh, i am not at all afraid of her dying. people do not die of little
trifling colds. she will be taken good care of. as long as she stays
there, it is all very well. i would go and see her if i could have the
carriage.”

elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the
carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was
her only alternative. she declared her resolution.

“how can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! you will not be fit to be seen when you get
there.”

“i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want.”

“is this a hint to me, lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
horses?”

“no, indeed. i do not wish to avoid the walk. the distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles. i shall be back by dinner.”

“i admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed mary, “but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”

“we will go as far as meryton with you,” said catherine and lydia.
elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.

“if we make haste,” said lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
see something of captain carter, before he goes.”

in meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers’ wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.

she was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and
miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it. she was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was
good-humour and kindness. mr. darcy said very little, and mr. hurst
nothing at all. the former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to
the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. the latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.

her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. miss
bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
enough to leave her room. elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. she was not equal,
however, to much conversation; and when miss bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. elizabeth silently attended
her.

when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for jane. the apothecary came; and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. the advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely. elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.

when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so. miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern
at parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the
present. elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
despatched to longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.

chapter viii.


[illustration]

at five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner. to the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of mr. bingley, she could not make a very
favourable answer. jane was by no means better. the sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards jane, when not immediately before them, restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.

their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. his anxiety for jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. she had very little notice from any but him. miss bingley was
engrossed by mr. darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr.
hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. mrs. hurst
thought the same, and added,--

“she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. i shall never forget her appearance this morning. she really
looked almost wild.”

“she did indeed, louisa. i could hardly keep my countenance. very
nonsensical to come at all! why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”

“yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, i am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office.”

“your picture may be very exact, louisa,” said bingley; “but this was
all lost upon me. i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well
when she came into the room this morning. her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice.”

“_you_ observed it, mr. darcy, i am sure,” said miss bingley; “and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such
an exhibition.”

“certainly not.”

“to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
it? it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum.”

“it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
bingley.

“i am afraid, mr. darcy,” observed miss bingley, in a half whisper,
“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes.”

“not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” a
short pause followed this speech, and mrs. hurst began again,--

“i have an excessive regard for jane bennet,--she is really a very sweet
girl,--and i wish with all my heart she were well settled. but with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no
chance of it.”

“i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
meryton?”

“yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside.”

“that is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.

“if they had uncles enough to fill _all_ cheapside,” cried bingley, “it
would not make them one jot less agreeable.”

“but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world,” replied darcy.

to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend’s vulgar relations.

with a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself. on entering the drawing-room, she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay
below, with a book. mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment.

“do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”

“miss eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, “despises cards. she is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”

“i deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried elizabeth; “i
am _not_ a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things.”

“in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure,” said bingley; “and
i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”

elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying. he immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.

“and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but i am an idle fellow; and though i have not many, i have more
than i ever looked into.”

elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.

“i am astonished,” said miss bingley, “that my father should have left
so small a collection of books. what a delightful library you have at
pemberley, mr. darcy!”

“it ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many
generations.”

“and then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying
books.”

“i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these.”

“neglect! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. charles, when you build _your_ house, i wish it may be
half as delightful as pemberley.”

“i wish it may.”

“but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model. there is not a
finer county in england than derbyshire.”

“with all my heart: i will buy pemberley itself, if darcy will sell it.”

“i am talking of possibilities, charles.”

“upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”

elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.

“is miss darcy much grown since the spring?” said miss bingley: “will
she be as tall as i am?”

“i think she will. she is now about miss elizabeth bennet’s height, or
rather taller.”

“how i long to see her again! i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished
for her age! her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”

“it is amazing to me,” said bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are.”

“all young ladies accomplished! my dear charles, what do you mean?”

“yes, all of them, i think. they all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and i am
sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without
being informed that she was very accomplished.”

“your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said darcy, “has
too much truth. the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but i am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. i
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my
acquaintance that are really accomplished.”

“nor i, i am sure,” said miss bingley.

“then,” observed elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman.”

“yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it.”

“oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved.”

“all this she must possess,” added darcy; “and to all she must yet add
something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive
reading.”

“i am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
i rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”

“are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?”

“_i_ never saw such a woman. _i_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”

mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when mr. hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. as all
conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.

“eliza bennet,” said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i daresay, it
succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”

“undoubtedly,” replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.”

miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.

elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her. bingley urged mr. jones’s being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. this she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled
that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet
were not decidedly better. bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. they solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.

chapter ix.


[illustration]

elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation. the note was immediately despatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. mrs. bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs. bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. she
would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. after sitting a little while with jane, on miss
bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour. bingley met them with hopes
that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.

“indeed i have, sir,” was her answer. “she is a great deal too ill to be
moved. mr. jones says we must not think of moving her. we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness.”

“removed!” cried bingley. “it must not be thought of. my sister, i am
sure, will not hear of her removal.”

“you may depend upon it, madam,” said miss bingley, with cold civility,
“that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us.”

mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

“i am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, i do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper i ever met with. i often tell my other girls they are nothing to
_her_. you have a sweet room here, mr. bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk. i do not know a place in the country that is
equal to netherfield. you will not think of quitting it in a hurry, i
hope, though you have but a short lease.”

“whatever i do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five
minutes. at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here.”

“that is exactly what i should have supposed of you,” said elizabeth.

“you begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.

“oh yes--i understand you perfectly.”

“i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through, i am afraid, is pitiful.”

“that is as it happens. it does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”

“lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”

“i did not know before,” continued bingley, immediately, “that you were
a studier of character. it must be an amusing study.”

“yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. they have at
least that advantage.”

“the country,” said darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study. in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.”

“but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.”

“yes, indeed,” cried mrs. bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood. “i assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town.”

everybody was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. mrs. bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph,--

“i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places. the country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, mr. bingley?”

“when i am in the country,” he replied, “i never wish to leave it; and
when i am in town, it is pretty much the same. they have each their
advantages, and i can be equally happy in either.”

“ay, that is because you have the right disposition. but that
gentleman,” looking at darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
at all.”

“indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. “you quite mistook mr. darcy. he only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true.”

“certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. i know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”

nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance. his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
mr. darcy with a very expressive smile. elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since _her_ coming away.

“yes, she called yesterday with her father. what an agreeable man sir
william is, mr. bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so
genteel and so easy! he has always something to say to everybody. _that_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”

“did charlotte dine with you?”

“no, she would go home. i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. for
my part, mr. bingley, _i_ always keep servants that can do their own
work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. but everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the lucases are a very good sort of girls, i
assure you. it is a pity they are not handsome! not that _i_ think
charlotte so _very_ plain; but then she is our particular friend.”

“she seems a very pleasant young woman,” said bingley.

“oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. lady lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me jane’s beauty. i do not like to boast
of my own child; but to be sure, jane--one does not often see anybody
better looking. it is what everybody says. i do not trust my own
partiality. when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my
brother gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
but, however, he did not. perhaps he thought her too young. however, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”

“and so ended his affection,” said elizabeth, impatiently. “there has
been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way. i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”

“i have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said darcy.

“of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. everything nourishes what is
strong already. but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”

darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. she longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs.
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to
jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy. mr. bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. she performed her part,
indeed, without much graciousness, but mrs. bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield.

lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. she had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her
own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. she was
very equal, therefore, to address mr. bingley on the subject of the
ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be
the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. his answer
to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.

“i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball. but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”

lydia declared herself satisfied. “oh yes--it would be much better to
wait till jane was well; and by that time, most likely, captain carter
would be at meryton again. and when you have given _your_ ball,” she
added, “i shall insist on their giving one also. i shall tell colonel
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”

mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all miss bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.

chapter x.


[illustration]

the day passed much as the day before had done. mrs. hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room. the loo table, however, did not appear.
mr. darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister. mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet, and
mrs. hurst was observing their game.

elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion. the perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.

“how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!”

he made no answer.

“you write uncommonly fast.”

“you are mistaken. i write rather slowly.”

“how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! letters of business, too! how odious i should think them!”

“it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”

“pray tell your sister that i long to see her.”

“i have already told her so once, by your desire.”

“i am afraid you do not like your pen. let me mend it for you. i mend
pens remarkably well.”

“thank you--but i always mend my own.”

“how can you contrive to write so even?”

he was silent.

“tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantley’s.”

“will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at
present i have not room to do them justice.”

“oh, it is of no consequence. i shall see her in january. but do you
always write such charming long letters to her, mr. darcy?”

“they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine.”

“it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease cannot write ill.”

“that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline,” cried her
brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. he studies too much
for words of four syllables. do not you, darcy?”

“my style of writing is very different from yours.”

“oh,” cried miss bingley, “charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”

“my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them; by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”

“your humility, mr. bingley,” said elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”

“nothing is more deceitful,” said darcy, “than the appearance of
humility. it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.”

“and which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”

“the indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. the power of doing anything with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. when you told mrs.
bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”

“nay,” cried bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. and yet, upon my honour, i
believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this
moment. at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”

“i daresay you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity. your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘bingley, you had better stay
till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month.”

“you have only proved by this,” cried elizabeth, “that mr. bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. you have shown him off now much
more than he did himself.”

“i am exceedingly gratified,” said bingley, “by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a
circumstance, i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i
could.”

“would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”

“upon my word, i cannot exactly explain the matter--darcy must speak for
himself.”

“you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which i have never acknowledged. allowing the case, however, to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet,
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety.”

“to yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you.”

“to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either.”

“you appear to me, mr. darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about mr. bingley. we may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon. but in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”

“will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?”

“by all means,” cried bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more
weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of. i assure
you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, i should not pay him half so much deference. i declare i do not
know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening,
when he has nothing to do.”

mr. darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.

“i see your design, bingley,” said his friend. “you dislike an argument,
and want to silence this.”

“perhaps i do. arguments are too much like disputes. if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”

“what you ask,” said elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and mr.
darcy had much better finish his letter.”

mr. darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music. miss bingley moved with alacrity to
the pianoforte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the
way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.

mrs. hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,
elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr. darcy’s eyes were fixed
on her. she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her was still more strange. she could only imagine, however,
at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
any other person present. the supposition did not pain her. she liked
him too little to care for his approbation.

after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a
lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr. darcy, drawing near
elizabeth, said to her,--

“do you not feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?”

she smiled, but made no answer. he repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.

“oh,” said she, “i heard you before; but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. you wanted me, i know, to say ‘yes,’
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. i have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you that i do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you
dare.”

“indeed i do not dare.”

elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. he really
believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.

miss bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.

she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

“i hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after
the officers. and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses.”

     “no, no; stay where you are”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

“have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”

“oh yes. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed
in the gallery at pemberley. put them next to your great-uncle the
judge. they are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. as for your elizabeth’s picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”

“it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.”

at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurst and
elizabeth herself.

“i did not know that you intended to walk,” said miss bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.

“you used us abominably ill,” answered mrs. hurst, “running away without
telling us that you were coming out.”

then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy, she left elizabeth to walk
by herself. the path just admitted three. mr. darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said,--

“this walk is not wide enough for our party. we had better go into the
avenue.”

but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,--

“no, no; stay where you are. you are charmingly grouped, and appear to
uncommon advantage. the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. good-bye.”

she then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.

     “piling up the fire”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]




chapter xi.


[illustration]

when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister, and
seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of
pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were
during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. their powers
of conversation were considerable. they could describe an entertainment
with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their
acquaintance with spirit.

but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object;
miss bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. he addressed
himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation; mr. hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingley’s salutation. he was full of joy and
attention. the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,
to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the
door. he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.

when tea was over mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain. she had obtained private intelligence that mr.
darcy did not wish for cards, and mr. hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. she assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. mr.
hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. darcy took up a book. miss bingley did the same;
and mrs. hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with miss
bennet.

miss bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr.
darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. she
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question and read on. at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “how pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way! i declare, after all, there is no
enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not
an excellent library.”

no one made any reply. she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,--

“by the bye charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield? i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.”

“if you mean darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing, and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send
round my cards.”

“i should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day.”

“much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say; but it would not be
near so much like a ball.”

miss bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room. her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. in the
desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,
turning to elizabeth, said,--

“miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude.”

elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: mr. darcy looked
up. he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. he was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere. what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his
meaning--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.

“not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be
severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
nothing about it.”

miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in
anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his
two motives.

“i have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. “you either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, i should be
completely in your way; and if the second, i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire.”

“oh, shocking!” cried miss bingley. “i never heard anything so
abominable. how shall we punish him for such a speech?”

“nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said elizabeth. “we
can all plague and punish one another. tease him--laugh at him. intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”

“but upon my honour i do _not_. i do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me _that_. tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! no,
no; i feel he may defy us there. and as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. mr.
darcy may hug himself.”

“mr. darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried elizabeth. “that is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. i dearly love a
laugh.”

“miss bingley,” said he, “has given me credit for more than can be. the
wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may
be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke.”

“certainly,” replied elizabeth, “there are such people, but i hope i am
not one of _them_. i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good. follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, i own, and i
laugh at them whenever i can. but these, i suppose, are precisely what
you are without.”

“perhaps that is not possible for anyone. but it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule.”

“such as vanity and pride.”

“yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. but pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.”

elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

“your examination of mr. darcy is over, i presume,” said miss bingley;
“and pray what is the result?”

“i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect. he owns it
himself without disguise.”

“no,” said darcy, “i have made no such pretension. i have faults enough,
but they are not, i hope, of understanding. my temper i dare not vouch
for. it is, i believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the
convenience of the world. i cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself. my
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. my temper
would perhaps be called resentful. my good opinion once lost is lost for
ever.”

“_that_ is a failing, indeed!” cried elizabeth. “implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character. but you have chosen your fault well. i
really cannot _laugh_ at it. you are safe from me.”

“there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”

“and _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”

“and yours,” he replied, with a smile, “is wilfully to misunderstand
them.”

“do let us have a little music,” cried miss bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share. “louisa, you will not mind my
waking mr. hurst.”

her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for
it. he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.

chapter xii.


[illustration]

in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. but mrs. bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which
would exactly finish jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. mrs.
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr. bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well. against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley’s carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.

to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence: elizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough. she attracted him more than he liked; and miss
bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. he
wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday: and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.

on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. miss bingley’s civility to elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.

they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. mrs. bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again. but their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. the
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and
elizabeth.

they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. catherine and lydia had information
for them of a different sort. much had been done, and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it
had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married.

chapter xiii


[illustration]

“i hope, my dear,” said mr. bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”

“who do you mean, my dear? i know of nobody that is coming, i am sure,
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in; and i hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her. i do not believe she often sees such at home.”

“the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger.”

mrs. bennet’s eyes sparkled. “a gentleman and a stranger! it is mr.
bingley, i am sure. why, jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly
thing! well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley.
but--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got
to-day. lydia, my love, ring the bell. i must speak to hill this
moment.”

“it is _not_ mr. bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life.”

this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.

after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus
explained:--“about a month ago i received this letter, and about a
fortnight ago i answered it; for i thought it a case of some delicacy,
and requiring early attention. it is from my cousin, mr. collins, who,
when i am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he
pleases.”

“oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
pray do not talk of that odious man. i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and i am sure, if i had been you, i should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it.”

jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
they had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which mrs.
bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

“it certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said mr. bennet; “and
nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.
but if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself.”

“no, that i am sure i shall not: and i think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. i hate such false
friends. why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?”

“why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear.”

     /* right “hunsford, near westerham, kent, _15th october_. */

“dear sir,

     “the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
     father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since i have had the
     misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the
     breach: but, for some time, i was kept back by my own doubts,
     fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be
     on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be
     at variance.”--‘there, mrs. bennet.’--“my mind, however, is now
     made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at easter,
     i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of
     the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis
     de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the
     valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
     endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
     ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
     which are instituted by the church of england. as a clergyman,
     moreover, i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
     of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
     these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of
     good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my
     being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly
     overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered
     olive branch. i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
     means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to
     apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make
     them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. if you should
     have no objection to receive me into your house, i propose myself
     the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, monday,
     november 18th, by four o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your
     hospitality till the saturday se’nnight following, which i can do
     without any inconvenience, as lady catherine is far from objecting
     to my occasional absence on a sunday, provided that some other
     clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. i remain, dear sir,
     with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your
     well-wisher and friend,

“william collins.”

“at four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”
said mr. bennet, as he folded up the letter. “he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, i doubt not, will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.”

“there is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if
he is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to
discourage him.”

“though it is difficult,” said jane, “to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit.”

elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.

“he must be an oddity, i think,” said she. “i cannot make him out. there
is something very pompous in his style. and what can he mean by
apologizing for being next in the entail? we cannot suppose he would
help it, if he could. can he be a sensible man, sir?”

“no, my dear; i think not. i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse. there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter which promises well. i am impatient to see him.”

“in point of composition,” said mary, “his letter does not seem
defective. the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i
think it is well expressed.”

to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. as for
their mother, mr. collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.

mr. collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. mr. bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr. collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. he was a tall,
heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. his air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. he had not been long seated
before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not
doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. this
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but mrs.
bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--

“you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. things are settled so
oddly.”

“you allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”

“ah, sir, i do indeed. it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. not that i mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,
i know, are all chance in this world. there is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed.”

“i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them. at present i will not say more, but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted----”

he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. they were not the only objects of mr. collins’s admiration. the
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs. bennet’s
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property. the dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its
cookery was owing. but here he was set right by mrs. bennet, who assured
him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. he begged
pardon for having displeased her. in a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a
quarter of an hour.

[illustration]

during dinner, mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. lady
catherine de bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable. mr. bennet could not have chosen
better. mr. collins was eloquent in her praise. the subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from lady catherine. she had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her. she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings,
and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two to visit his relations. she had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.

“that is all very proper and civil, i am sure,” said mrs. bennet, “and i
dare say she is a very agreeable woman. it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. does she live near you, sir?”

“the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from rosings park, her ladyship’s residence.”

“i think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?”

“she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very
extensive property.”

“ah,” cried mrs. bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than
many girls. and what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?”

“she is a most charming young lady, indeed. lady catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth. she is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as i am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”

“has she been presented? i do not remember her name among the ladies at
court.”

“her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived
the british court of its brightest ornament. her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea; and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies. i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her. these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay.”

“you judge very properly,” said mr. bennet; “and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?”

“they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though i
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.”

mr. bennet’s expectations were fully answered. his cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.

by tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and mr. bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,
glad to invite him

[illustration:

“protested
that he never read novels”      h.t feb 94
]

to read aloud to the ladies. mr. collins readily assented, and a book
was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be
from a circulating library) he started back, and, begging pardon,
protested that he never read novels. kitty stared at him, and lydia
exclaimed. other books were produced, and after some deliberation he
chose “fordyce’s sermons.” lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,--

“do you know, mamma, that my uncle philips talks of turning away
richard? and if he does, colonel forster will hire him. my aunt told me
so herself on saturday. i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town.”

lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr.
collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--

“i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. it amazes
me, i confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. but i will no longer importune my young cousin.”

then, turning to mr. bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. mr. bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. mrs.
bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for lydia’s
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but mr. collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with mr. bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.

chapter xv.


[illustration]

mr. collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. the subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.

his plan did not vary on seeing them. miss bennet’s lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice. the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with mrs. bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on. “as to
her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her
_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to
hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”

mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire. elizabeth, equally
next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

mrs. bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.

lydia’s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten: every sister
except mary agreed to go with her; and mr. collins was to attend them,
at the request of mr. bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither mr. collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr.
bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford. such
doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly. in his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and mr. collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.

in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton. the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. their eyes
were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.

but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way. the officer was the very
mr. denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire, and
he bowed as they passed. all were struck with the stranger’s air, all
wondered who he could be; and kitty and lydia, determined if possible
to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting
something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the
pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same
spot. mr. denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, mr. wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in
their corps. this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming. his appearance was
greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. the introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were
seen riding down the street. on distinguishing the ladies of the group
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities. bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the
principal object. he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her. mr. darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red. mr. wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return.
what could be the meaning of it? it was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.

in another minute mr. bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr. philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia’s
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs.
philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.

mrs. philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see mr. jones’s shopboy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield,
because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards mr. collins by jane’s introduction of him. she received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice. mrs. philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr. denny had
brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s
commission in the ----shire. she had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had mr. wickham
appeared, kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,
disagreeable fellows.” some of them were to dine with the philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr.
wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn
would come in the evening. this was agreed to; and mrs. philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. the prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. mr.
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,
with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.

as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.

mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs.
philips’s manners and politeness. he protested that, except lady
catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. something, he supposed, might be
attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.

chapter xvi.


[illustration]

as no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their
aunt, and all mr. collins’s scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that mr. wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in
the house.

when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr.
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when mrs. philips understood from him what rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of lady catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper’s room.

in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in mrs. philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could. to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. it was over at last, however.
the gentlemen did approach: and when mr. wickham walked into the room,
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. the
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but
mr, wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

[illustration:

“the officers of the ----shire”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.

with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the
officers, mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in mrs. philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin.

when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,
in return, by sitting down to whist.

“i know little of the game at present,” said he, “but i shall be glad to
improve myself; for in my situation of life----” mrs. philips was very
thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.

mr. wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia. at first there
seemed danger of lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.
allowing for the common demands of the game, mr. wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,
though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,
the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy. she dared not even
mention that gentleman. her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. mr. wickham began the subject himself. he inquired how far
netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there.

“about a month,” said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i
understand.”

“yes,” replied wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. a clear ten
thousand per annum. you could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been
connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.”

elizabeth could not but look surprised.

“you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday. are you much acquainted with mr. darcy?”

“as much as i ever wish to be,” cried elizabeth, warmly. “i have spent
four days in the same house with him, and i think him very
disagreeable.”

“i have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said wickham, “as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. i am not qualified to form one. i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. it is impossible for _me_ to
be impartial. but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. here you are in your own family.”

“upon my word i say no more _here_ than i might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except netherfield. he is not at all liked in
hertfordshire. everybody is disgusted with his pride. you will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone.”

“i cannot pretend to be sorry,” said wickham, after a short
interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ i believe it does not often happen. the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”

“i should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.”

wickham only shook his head.

“i wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer.”

“i do not at all know; but i _heard_ nothing of his going away when i
was at netherfield. i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”

“oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by mr. darcy. if _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. we are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what i might proclaim to all the world--a sense of
very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.
his father, miss bennet, the late mr. darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be
in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections. his behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and
everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father.”

elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.

mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.

“it was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,
“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. i know it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them.
society, i own, is necessary to me. i have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. i _must_ have employment and society.
a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. the church _ought_ to have been my profession--i
was brought up for the church; and i should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now.”

“indeed!”

“yes--the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift. he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
i cannot do justice to his kindness. he meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere.”

“good heavens!” cried elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? how could his
will be disregarded? why did not you seek legal redress?”

“there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. a man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but mr. darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. i have a warm unguarded temper, and i
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too
freely. i can recall nothing worse. but the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me.”

“this is quite shocking! he deserves to be publicly disgraced.”

“some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. till i
can forget his father, i can never defy or expose _him_.”

elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.

“but what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?”

“a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. had the late mr. darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, i believe, very early in life. he had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
of preference which was often given me.”

“i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked
him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!”

after a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “i _do_
remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. his disposition
must be dreadful.”

“i will not trust myself on the subject,” replied wickham; “_i_ can
hardly be just to him.”

elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “to
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father!” she could have added, “a young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” but she contented herself
with--“and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest
manner.”

“we were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _my_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr. philips,
appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use
to the late mr. darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property. he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;
and when, immediately before my father’s death, mr. darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it
to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”

“how strange!” cried elizabeth. “how abominable! i wonder that the very
pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you. if from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty i must call it.”

“it _is_ wonderful,” replied wickham; “for almost all his actions may be
traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. it has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. but we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride.”

“can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”

“yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor. family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his
father was, have done this. not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
pemberley house, is a powerful motive. he has also _brotherly_ pride,
which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers.”

“what sort of a girl is miss darcy?”

he shook his head. “i wish i could call her amiable. it gives me pain to
speak ill of a darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very
proud. as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. but she is
nothing to me now. she is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, i understand, highly accomplished. since her father’s death her
home has been london, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
education.”

after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--

“i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley. how can mr. bingley,
who seems good-humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man? how can they suit each other? do you
know mr. bingley?”

“not at all.”

“he is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. he cannot know what mr.
darcy is.”

“probably not; but mr. darcy can please where he chooses. he does not
want abilities. he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. his pride
never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure.”

the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and mr. collins took his station between his cousin
elizabeth and mrs. philips. the usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter. it had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.

“i know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a
card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. there
are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to lady
catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters.”

mr. wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing mr. collins for
a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.

“lady catherine de bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a
living. i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”

“you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy.”

“no, indeed, i did not. i knew nothing at all of lady catherine’s
connections. i never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday.”

“her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”

this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss
bingley. vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.

“mr. collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her
ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of
her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”

“i believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied wickham; “i have
not seen her for many years; but i very well remember that i never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. she has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class.”

elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr.
wickham’s attentions. there could be no conversation in the noise of
mrs. philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to
everybody. whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully. elizabeth went away with her head full of him. she could
think of nothing but of mr. wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent. lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won; and mr. collins, in describing the civility of mr. and
mrs. philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.

[illustration]

elizabeth related to jane, the next day, what had passed between mr.
wickham and herself. jane listened with astonishment and concern: she
knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr.
bingley’s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham. the
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.

“they have both,” said she, “been deceived, i dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea. interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. it is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.”

“very true, indeed; and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business? do clear _them_, too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody.”

“laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places mr. darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a
manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. it is
impossible. no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it. can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him? oh no.”

“i can much more easily believe mr. bingley’s being imposed on than that
mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last
night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. if it be not
so, let mr. darcy contradict it. besides, there was truth in his looks.”

“it is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. one does not know what to
think.”

“i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”

but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr.
bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when
the affair became public.

the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was
fixed for the following tuesday. the two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation. to the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others. they were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet’s civilities.

the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr.
wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr. darcy’s look
and behaviour. the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they
each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham,
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. and even mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it.

“while i can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. i
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody.”

elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley’s invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,
either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to
dance.

“i am by no means of opinion, i assure you,” said he, “that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing
myself, that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening; and i take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”

elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. she had fully proposed being
engaged by wickham for those very dances; and to have mr. collins
instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. there was no help
for it, however. mr. wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce
delayed a little longer, and mr. collins’s proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could. she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. it now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. elizabeth, however, did not choose
to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. mr. collins might never make the offer, and,
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.

if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;
for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once. no
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses
for netherfield were got by proxy. even elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement
of her acquaintance with mr. wickham; and nothing less than a dance on
tuesday could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday, and monday
endurable to kitty and lydia.

chapter xviii.


[illustration]

till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield, and looked in
vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. the certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. she had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. but in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for mr. darcy’s
pleasure, in the bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend mr. denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,--

“i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”

this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by
elizabeth; and, as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to wickham. she
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to mr. bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.

but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and, having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she
had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary
transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her
particular notice. the two first dances, however, brought a return of
distress: they were dances of mortification. mr. collins, awkward and
solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong
without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a
disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. the moment of her
release from him was ecstasy.

she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. when those dances
were over, she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him. he walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind: charlotte tried to console her.

“i dare say you will find him very agreeable.”

“heaven forbid! _that_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! to find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! do not wish me such an
evil.”

when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her
hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy, and
reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
they stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at
first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it
would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,
she made some slight observation on the dance. he replied, and was again
silent. after a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,
with--

“it is _your_ turn to say something now, mr. darcy. _i_ talked about the
dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the
room, or the number of couples.”

he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.

“very well; that reply will do for the present. perhaps, by-and-by, i
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but
_now_ we may be silent.”

“do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”

“sometimes. one must speak a little, you know. it would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible.”

“are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?”

“both,” replied elizabeth archly; “for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. we are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”

“this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure,”
said he. “how near it may be to _mine_, i cannot pretend to say. _you_
think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”

“i must not decide on my own performance.”

he made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton. she answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, “when you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance.”

the effect was immediate. a deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he said not a word; and elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on. at length darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,--

“mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his
_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,
is less certain.”

“he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied elizabeth,
with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life.”

darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving mr.
darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.

“i have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very
superior dancing is not often seen. it is evident that you belong to the
first circles. allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you: and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza (glancing
at her sister and bingley), shall take place. what congratulations will
then flow in! i appeal to mr. darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of
that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”

[illustration:

often seen.”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir
william’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards bingley and
jane, who were dancing together. recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,--

“sir william’s interruption has made me forget what we were talking
of.”

“i do not think we were speaking at all. sir william could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves. we have tried two or three subjects already without success,
and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine.”

“what think you of books?” said he, smiling.

“books--oh no!--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings.”

“i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. we may compare our different opinions.”

“no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.”

“the _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,
with a look of doubt.

“yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, “i remember hearing you once say, mr. darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was
unappeasable. you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its _being
created_?”

“i am,” said he, with a firm voice.

“and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”

“i hope not.”

“it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first.”

“may i ask to what these questions tend?”

“merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. “i am trying to make it out.”

“and what is your success?”

she shook her head. “i do not get on at all. i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”

“i can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”

“but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another
opportunity.”

“i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.
she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for
in darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.

they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and,
with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--

“so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham?
your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his
other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the late mr.
darcy’s steward. let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give
implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to mr. darcy’s using
him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always
remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a
most infamous manner. i do not know the particulars, but i know very
well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear
to hear george wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he
could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he
was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and
i wonder how he could presume to do it. i pity you, miss eliza, for this
discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his
descent, one could not expect much better.”

“his guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”
said elizabeth, angrily; “for i have heard you accuse him of nothing
worse than of being the son of mr. darcy’s steward, and of _that_, i can
assure you, he informed me himself.”

“i beg your pardon,” replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer.
“excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”

“insolent girl!” said elizabeth to herself. “you are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr.
darcy.” she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley. jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude
for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave
way before the hope of jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.

“i want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister’s, “what you have learnt about mr. wickham. but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case
you may be sure of my pardon.”

“no,” replied jane, “i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. mr. bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended mr. darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has
received; and i am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his
sister’s, mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man. i am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr. darcy’s
regard.”

“mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself.”

“no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton.”

“this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy. i am
perfectly satisfied. but what does he say of the living?”

“he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from mr. darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only.”

“i have not a doubt of mr. bingley’s sincerity,” said elizabeth warmly,
“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. mr.
bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, i dare say; but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as i did before.”

she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of
bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. on their being joined by mr. bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before mr. collins came up to them,
and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate
as to make a most important discovery.

“i have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation to my patroness. i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother,
lady catherine. how wonderfully these sort of things occur! who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly! i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”

“you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy?”

“indeed i am. i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
i believe him to be lady catherine’s _nephew_. it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”

elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr. darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. mr. collins listened to her with
the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased
speaking, replied thus,--

“my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those
which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that i consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained. you must, therefore, allow me to follow the
dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform
what i look on as a point of duty. pardon me for neglecting to profit by
your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,
though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education
and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident. her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”
“hunsford,” and “lady catherine de bourgh.” it vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man. mr. darcy was eyeing him with
unrestrained wonder; and when at last mr. collins allowed him to speak,
replied with an air of distant civility. mr. collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and mr. darcy’s contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: mr.
collins then returned to elizabeth.

“i have no reason, i assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my
reception. mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. he answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of lady catherine’s discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. it was really a very
handsome thought. upon the whole, i am much pleased with him.”

as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley; and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made
her perhaps almost as happy as jane. she saw her in idea settled in that
very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could
bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
even to like bingley’s two sisters. her mother’s thoughts she plainly
saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,
lest she might hear too much. when they sat down to supper, therefore,
she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within
one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was
talking to that one person (lady lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing
else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr.
bingley. it was an animating subject, and mrs. bennet seemed incapable
of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. his being such
a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,
were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a
comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be
certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. it
was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as
jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;
and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to
consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might
not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. it was necessary
to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such
occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs.
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.

in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy, who sat opposite to them. her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.

“what is mr. darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him? i am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”

“for heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. what advantage can it be to you
to offend mr. darcy? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing.”

nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation. she could not help frequently
glancing her eye at mr. darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.

at length, however, mrs. bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
elizabeth now began to revive. but not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. by many significant looks and silent
entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and
she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another. mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected. elizabeth was in agonies.
she looked at jane to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly
talking to bingley. she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued, however,
impenetrably grave. she looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest mary should be singing all night. he took the hint,
and, when mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--

“that will do extremely well, child. you have delighted us long enough.
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”

mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good. others of the party were now applied to.

“if i,” said mr. collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i
should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. i do not mean, however,
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. the
rector of a parish has much to do. in the first place, he must make such
an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. he must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards
everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. i
cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who
should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody
connected with the family.” and with a bow to mr. darcy, he concluded
his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the
room. many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr.
bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for
having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to lady
lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.

to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. that his two sisters and mr. darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

the rest of the evening brought her little amusement. she was teased by
mr. collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others. in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the
room. he assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent
to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend
himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining
close to her the whole evening. there was no arguing upon such a
project. she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who
often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged mr. collins’s conversation
to herself.

she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy’s further notice:
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham, and rejoiced in
it.

the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
manœuvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an
hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. mrs. hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. they repulsed
every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long
speeches of mr. collins, who was complimenting mr. bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. darcy said
nothing at all. mr. bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
mr. bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “lord,
how tired i am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.

when at length they arose to take leave, mrs. bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation. bingley was all grateful
pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her after his return from london, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.

mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four
months. of having another daughter married to mr. collins she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield.

chapter xix.


[illustration]

the next day opened a new scene at longbourn. mr. collins made his
declaration in form. having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. on finding
mrs. bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--

“may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth,
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?”

before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, mrs.
bennet instantly answered,--

“oh dear! yes, certainly. i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am sure
she can have no objection. come, kitty, i want you upstairs.” and
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth
called out,--

“dear ma’am, do not go. i beg you will not go. mr. collins must excuse
me. he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. i am
going away myself.”

“no, no, nonsense, lizzy. i desire you will stay where you are.” and
upon elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, “lizzy, i _insist_ upon your staying and hearing
mr. collins.”

elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion. mrs. bennet and kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone, mr. collins began,--

“believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. you
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected
mother’s permission for this address. you can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. almost as
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my
future life. but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, for coming into hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as i certainly did.”

the idea of mr. collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued,--

“my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that i am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps i ought to
have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling
patroness. twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
too!) on this subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i
left hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while mrs. jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘mr. collins, you
must marry. a clergyman like you must marry. choose properly, choose a
gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. this is my advice. find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her.’ allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and
kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. you will find her manners beyond
anything i can describe; and your wit and vivacity, i think, must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite. thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i
assure you there are many amiable young women. but the fact is, that
being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father (who, however, may live many years longer), i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be
for several years. this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. to fortune i am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. on that head,
therefore, i shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”

it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

“you are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “you forget that i have made no
answer. let me do it without further loss of time. accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. i am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them.”

“i am not now to learn,” replied mr. collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time. i am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have
just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”

“upon my word, sir,” cried elizabeth, “your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration. i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. i am perfectly serious in my refusal. you could not make _me_
happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
would make _you_ so. nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation.”

“were it certain that lady catherine would think so,” said mr. collins,
very gravely--“but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. and you may be certain that when i have the honour of
seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications.”

“indeed, mr. collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. you must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what i say. i wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. this matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled.” and rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr. collins thus
addressed her,--

“when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character.”

“really, mr. collins,” cried elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me
exceedingly. if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one.”

“you must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. my reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly desirable. my situation in life, my connections
with the family of de bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. your
portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the
effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. as i must,
therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i
shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”

“i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. my feelings in every respect
forbid it. can i speak plainer? do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart.”

“you are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; “and i am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable.”

to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.

chapter xx.


[illustration]

mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for mrs. bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. mr. collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.

this information, however, startled mrs. bennet: she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
and could not help saying so.

“but depend upon it, mr. collins,” she added, “that lizzy shall be
brought to reason. i will speak to her about it myself directly. she is
a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
i will _make_ her know it.”

“pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried mr. collins; “but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. if, therefore, she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”

“sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said mrs. bennet, alarmed. “lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. in everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived. i will go directly to mr. bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure.”

she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out, as she entered the library,--

“oh, mr. bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins, for she vows she will
not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have _her_.”

mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by
her communication.

“i have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had
finished her speech. “of what are you talking?”

“of mr. collins and lizzy. lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins,
and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy.”

“and what am i to do on the occasion? it seems a hopeless business.”

“speak to lizzy about it yourself. tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him.”

“let her be called down. she shall hear my opinion.”

mrs. bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
library.

“come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “i have sent for
you on an affair of importance. i understand that mr. collins has made
you an offer of marriage. is it true?”

elizabeth replied that it was.

“very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”

“i have, sir.”

“very well. we now come to the point. your mother insists upon your
accepting it. is it not so, mrs. bennet?”

“yes, or i will never see her again.”

“an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth. from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry mr. collins, and i will never see you again
if you _do_.”

elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but mrs. bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.

“what do you mean, mr. bennet, by talking in this way? you promised me
to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”

“my dear,” replied her husband, “i have two small favours to request.
first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and, secondly, of my room. i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be.”

not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
mrs. bennet give up the point. she talked to elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns. she endeavoured to secure jane in
her interest, but jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. though her manner
varied, however, her determination never did.

mr. collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend
the day with them. she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, “i am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! what do you think has happened this morning? mr. collins has
made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him.”

[illustration:

     “they entered the breakfast room”
]

charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty,
who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where mrs. bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of her
family. “pray do, my dear miss lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;
“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; i am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves.”

charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.

“ay, there she comes,” continued mrs. bennet, “looking as unconcerned as
may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided she
can have her own way. but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. _i_ shall not be able to keep
you--and so i warn you. i have done with you from this very day. i told
you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you again,
and you will find me as good as my word. i have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. not that i have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
to anybody. people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. nobody can tell what i suffer! but it
is always so. those who do not complain are never pitied.”

her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.
she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by mr. collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--

“now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let mr. collins and me have a little conversation together.”

elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but
lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte,
detained first by the civility of mr. collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected
conversation:--

“oh, mr. collins!”

“my dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.
far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as i have been, in early preferment; and, i
trust, i am resigned. perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i
have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.
you will not, i hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your
family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.
my conduct may, i fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all
liable to error. i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologize.”

the discussion of mr. collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.
as for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence. he scarcely ever spoke to
her; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.

the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet’s ill humour or ill
health. mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride. elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it. he was always to have gone on
saturday, and to saturday he still meant to stay.

after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton, to inquire if mr. wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.
he joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
aunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were
well talked over. to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.

“i found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that i had better not meet
mr. darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”

she highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with
them to longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.
his accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.

[illustration: “walked back with them”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came
from netherfield, and was opened immediately. the envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s
fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to
join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but
elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs. when they
had gained their own room, jane, taking out her letter, said, “this is
from caroline bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.
the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way
to town; and without any intention of coming back again. you shall hear
what she says.”

she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr.
hurst had a house. the next was in these words:--“‘i do not pretend to
regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the
meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence. i depend on you for that.’” to these
high-flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley’s being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon
cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.

“it is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness, to which miss bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? mr. bingley will not be detained in london by
them.”

“caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter. i will read it to you.

“‘when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to london might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter: i wish i could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that i
despair. i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of
whom we shall deprive you.’

“it is evident by this,” added jane, “that he comes back no more this
winter.”

“it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he _should_.”

“why will you think so? it must be his own doing; he is his own master.
but you do not know _all_. i _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. i will have no reserves from _you_. ‘mr. darcy is
impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely
less eager to meet her again. i really do not think georgiana darcy has
her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection
she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still
more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being
hereafter our sister. i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to
you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the country
without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. my brother admires her greatly already; he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s
partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most
capable of engaging any woman’s heart. with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest
jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?’ what think you of _this_ sentence, my dear lizzy?” said
jane, as she finished it. “is it not clear enough? does it not expressly
declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;
that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that
if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most
kindly!) to put me on my guard. can there be any other opinion on the
subject?”

“yes, there can; for mine is totally different. will you hear it?”

“most willingly.”

“you shall have it in a few words. miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy. she follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you.”

jane shook her head.

“indeed, jane, you ought to believe me. no one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection; miss bingley, i am sure, cannot: she
is not such a simpleton. could she have seen half as much love in mr.
darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. but the
case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion
that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i
dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way. but, my
dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”

“if we thought alike of miss bingley,” replied jane, “your
representation of all this might make me quite easy. but i know the
foundation is unjust. caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself.”

“that is right. you could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.
you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”

“but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?”

“you must decide for yourself,” said elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you,
by all means, to refuse him.”

“how can you talk so?” said jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could
not hesitate.”

“i did not think you would; and that being the case, i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion.”

“but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. a thousand things may arise in six months.”

the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline’s
interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.

she represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
bingley would return to netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.

they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. after
lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of
thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at
longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,
that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take
care to have two full courses.

chapter xxii.


[illustration]

the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases; and again, during the
chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins.
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “it keeps him in good
humour,” said she, “and i am more obliged to you than i can express.”

charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. this was
very amiable; but charlotte’s kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her
from any return of mr. collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. such was miss lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character; for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
himself at her feet. he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday. his
reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. miss lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. but little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

in as short a time as mr. collins’s long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness. the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.

sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. mr. collins’s present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair. lady lucas began directly to calculate, with more
interest than the matter had ever

[illustration:

     “so much love and eloquence”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

excited before, how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live; and
sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever mr. collins
should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly
expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st.
james’s. the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the
occasion. the younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two
sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved
from their apprehension of charlotte’s dying an old maid. charlotte
herself was tolerably composed. she had gained her point, and had time
to consider of it. her reflections were in general satisfactory. mr.
collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was
irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. but still he would
be her husband. without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,
marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable
provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however
uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative
from want. this preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of
twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good
luck of it. the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the
surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she
valued beyond that of any other person. elizabeth would wonder, and
probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. she resolved
to give her the information herself; and therefore charged mr. collins,
when he returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. a promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love.

as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of
the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies
moved for the night; and mrs. bennet, with great politeness and
cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again,
whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.

“my dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible.”

they were all astonished; and mr. bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,--

“but is there not danger of lady catherine’s disapprobation here, my
good sir? you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness.”

“my dear sir,” replied mr. collins, “i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship’s concurrence.”

“you cannot be too much on your guard. risk anything rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”

“believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in hertfordshire. as for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin elizabeth.”

with proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. mrs. bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
agreeable companion. but on the following morning every hope of this
kind was done away. miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.

the possibility of mr. collins’s fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two: but
that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility
as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
she could not help crying out,--

“engaged to mr. collins! my dear charlotte, impossible!”

the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure, and calmly replied,--

“why should you be surprised, my dear eliza? do you think it incredible
that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”

but elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the
prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she
wished her all imaginable happiness.

“i see what you are feeling,” replied charlotte; “you must be surprised,
very much surprised, so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you.
but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be
satisfied with what i have done. i am not romantic, you know. i never
was. i ask only a comfortable home; and, considering mr. collins’s
character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.”

elizabeth quietly answered “undoubtedly;” and, after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. charlotte did not stay much
longer; and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. it
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match. the strangeness of mr. collins’s making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted. she had always felt that charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible
that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. charlotte, the wife of mr. collins, was a
most humiliating picture! and to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.

     “protested he must be entirely mistaken.”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]




chapter xxiii.


[illustration]

elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,
when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family. with many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for mrs. bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--

“good lord! sir william, how can you tell such a story? do not you know
that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy?”

nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment: but sir william’s good-breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.

elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she
was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of mr. collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.

mrs. bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent. in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr. collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. nothing could
console and nothing appease her. nor did that day wear out her
resentment. a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to sir william
or lady lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.

mr. bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!

jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. kitty and
lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr. collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at meryton.

lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though mrs. bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.

between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again. her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.

jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. the promised
letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. after
discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,
with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the
affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained
that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had
been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at
longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight;
for lady catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that
she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would
be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early
day for making him the happiest of men.

mr. collins’s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to mrs. bennet. on the contrary, she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband. it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley’s continued
absence.

neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs.
bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.

even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive to jane’s happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring. the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.

as for jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing; and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to. but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he
did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. it needed all
jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.

mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. he was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company. the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

[illustration:

     “_whenever she spoke in a low voice_”
]

mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state. the very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. the sight of
miss lucas was odious to her. as her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. whenever charlotte came to see
them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr. bennet was dead. she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

“indeed, mr. bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _i_ should be forced
to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!”

“my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. let us hope for
better things. let us flatter ourselves that _i_ may be the survivor.”

this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet; and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before.

“i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. if it was
not for the entail, i should not mind it.”

“what should not you mind?”

“i should not mind anything at all.”

“let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.”

“i never can be thankful, mr. bennet, for anything about the entail. how
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own
daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr. collins, too!
why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”

“i leave it to yourself to determine,” said mr. bennet.

chapter xxiv.


[illustration]

miss bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. the very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left
the country.

hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. miss darcy’s praise occupied
the chief of it. her many attractions were again dwelt on; and caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an
inmate of mr. darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.

elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. her heart was divided between concern
for her sister and resentment against all others. to caroline’s
assertion of her brother’s being partial to miss darcy, she paid no
credit. that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations. had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as
she thought he must be sensible himself. it was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. she
could think of nothing else; and yet, whether bingley’s regard had
really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;
whether he had been aware of jane’s attachment, or whether it had
escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of
him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s
situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.

a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth; but at last, on mrs. bennet’s leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,--

“o that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. but i
will not repine. it cannot last long. he will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before.”

elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

“you doubt me,” cried jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no
reason. he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance but that is all. i have nothing either to hope or fear, and
nothing to reproach him with. thank god i have not _that_ pain. a little
time, therefore--i shall certainly try to get the better----”

with a stronger voice she soon added, “i have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself.”

“my dear jane,” exclaimed elizabeth, “you are too good. your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to
you. i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.”

miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister’s warm affection.

“nay,” said elizabeth, “this is not fair. _you_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody. _i_ only want
to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. you need not. there are few people
whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well. the more i see
of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense. i have met with two instances lately: one i will not mention,
the other is charlotte’s marriage. it is unaccountable! in every view it
is unaccountable!”

“my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. they will
ruin your happiness. you do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper. consider mr. collins’s respectability, and
charlotte’s prudent, steady character. remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin.”

“to oblige you, i would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her
understanding than i now do of her heart. my dear jane, mr. collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as
i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries him
cannot have a proper way of thinking. you shall not defend her, though
it is charlotte lucas. you shall not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness.”

“i must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied
jane; “and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together. but enough of this. you alluded to something else. you
mentioned _two_ instances. i cannot misunderstand you, but i entreat
you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. women fancy admiration means more than
it does.”

“and men take care that they should.”

“if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”

“i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingley’s conduct to design,”
said elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business.”

“and do you impute it to either of those?”

“yes; to the last. but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i
think of persons you esteem. stop me, whilst you can.”

“you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”

“yes, in conjunction with his friend.”

“i cannot believe it. why should they try to influence him? they can
only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can
secure it.”

“your first position is false. they may wish many things besides his
happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride.”

“beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy,” replied jane;
“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. they have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother’s. what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? if they believed him attached to me they would not try to
part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. by supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. do not distress me by the idea. i am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”

elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr. bingley’s
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more; and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity. her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. mrs. bennet’s best
comfort was, that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer.

mr. bennet treated the matter differently. “so, lizzy,” said he, one
day, “your sister is crossed in love, i find. i congratulate her. next
to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and
then. it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. when is your turn to come? you will hardly bear to
be long outdone by jane. now is your time. here are officers enough at
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. let wickham
be your man. he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”

“thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. we must not
all expect jane’s good fortune.”

“true,” said mr. bennet; “but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will
always make the most of it.”

mr. wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family. they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on mr. darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they
had known anything of the matter.

miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of
hertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else
mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men.

chapter xxv.


[illustration]

after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr.
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
saturday. the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to
hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. he took leave
of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.

on the following monday, mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the christmas at
longbourn. mr. gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
well-bred and agreeable. mrs. gardiner, who was several years younger
than mrs. bennet and mrs. philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with her longbourn nieces. between the two
eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.
they had frequently been staying with her in town.

the first part of mrs. gardiner’s business, on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. when this was
done, she had a less active part to play. it became her turn to listen.
mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. they
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.

“i do not blame jane,” she continued, “for jane would have got mr.
bingley if she could. but, lizzy! oh, sister! it is very hard to think
that she might have been mr. collins’s wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness. he made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him. the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever. the lucases are very artful people, indeed,
sister. they are all for what they can get. i am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. it makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. however, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of
long sleeves.”

mrs. gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of jane and elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
conversation.

when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.
“it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane,” said she. “i
am sorry it went off. but these things happen so often! a young man,
such as you describe mr. bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty
girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily
forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.”

[illustration:

     “offended two or three young ladies”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

“an excellent consolation in its way,” said elizabeth; “but it will not
do for _us_. we do not suffer by accident. it does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before.”

“but that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. it is as
often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour’s
acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. pray, how _violent was_
mr. bingley’s love?”

“i never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and i
spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. could there be
finer symptoms? is not general incivility the very essence of love?”

“oh, yes! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt. poor
jane! i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately. it had better have happened to _you_, lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. but do you think she would
be prevailed on to go back with us? change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything.”

elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister’s ready acquiescence.

“i hope,” added mrs. gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her. we live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her.”

“and _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a
part of london! my dear aunt, how could you think of it? mr. darcy may,
perhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as gracechurch street, but he
would hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, mr. bingley
never stirs without him.”

“so much the better. i hope they will not meet at all. but does not jane
correspond with his sister? _she_ will not be able to help calling.”

“she will drop the acquaintance entirely.”

but, in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley’s being
withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless. it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane’s
attractions.

miss bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she
hoped, by caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother, she
might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.

the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses,
the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner. when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions mrs. gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth’s
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.

to mrs. gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. about ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of derbyshire to which he belonged. they had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcy’s father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been
in the way of procuring.

mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr. darcy by
character perfectly well. here, consequently, was an inexhaustible
subject of discourse. in comparing her recollection of pemberley with
the minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself. on being made acquainted with the
present mr. darcy’s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman’s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might
agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having
heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,
ill-natured boy.

chapter xxvi.


[illustration]

mrs. gardiner’s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--

“you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking
openly. seriously, i would have you be on your guard. do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent. i have nothing to say against
_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, i should think you could not do better. but as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you. you have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, i am sure. you must not disappoint your father.”

“my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”

“yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”

“well, then, you need not be under any alarm. i will take care of
myself, and of mr. wickham too. he shall not be in love with me, if i
can prevent it.”

“elizabeth, you are not serious now.”

“i beg your pardon. i will try again. at present i am not in love with
mr. wickham; no, i certainly am not. but he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--i believe it will be better that he should not. i see the imprudence
of it. oh, _that_ abominable mr. darcy! my father’s opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it. my
father, however, is partial to mr. wickham. in short, my dear aunt, i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are
seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow-creatures, if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that
it would be wiser to resist? all that i can promise you, therefore, is
not to be in a hurry. i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his
first object. when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing. in
short, i will do my best.”

“perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often. at least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”

“as i did the other day,” said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. but do not imagine
that he is always here so often. it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week. you know my mother’s ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. but really, and upon my
honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now i hope you
are satisfied.”

her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth, having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point without being resented.

mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane; but, as he took up his abode with the
lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs. bennet. his
marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned
as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured
tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” thursday was to be the
wedding-day, and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and
when she rose to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s
ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,
accompanied her out of the room. as they went down stairs together,
charlotte said,--

“i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza.”

“_that_ you certainly shall.”

“and i have another favour to ask. will you come and see me?”

“we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire.”

“i am not likely to leave kent for some time. promise me, therefore, to
come to hunsford.”

elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.

“my father and maria are to come to me in march,” added charlotte, “and
i hope you will consent to be of the party. indeed, eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them.”

the wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual. elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible. elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been rather than what was. charlotte’s first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. she
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine’s behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. it was mr. collins’s picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.

jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their
safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.

her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from caroline. she accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been
lost.

“my aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street.”

she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.
“i did not think caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london. i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.
i inquired after their brother, of course. he was well, but so much
engaged with mr. darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner: i wish i could see her. my visit was
not long, as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out. i dare say i shall
soon see them here.”

elizabeth shook her head over this letter. it convinced her that
accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sister’s being in town.

four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him. she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingley’s inattention. after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet
more, the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself
no longer. the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister
will prove what she felt:--

     “my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
     her better judgment, at my expense, when i confess myself to have
     been entirely deceived in miss bingley’s regard for me. but, my
     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
     obstinate if i still assert that, considering what her behaviour
     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. i do not at
     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,
     if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should
     be deceived again. caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
     and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the meantime. when she
     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she
     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a
     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so
     altered a creature, that when she went away i was perfectly
     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. i pity, though i
     cannot help blaming, her. she was very wrong in singling me out as
     she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
     her side. but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been
     acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her
     brother is the cause of it. i need not explain myself farther; and
     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. i cannot but wonder,
     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all
     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. he knows of my
     being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and
     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
     persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy. i cannot
     understand it. if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should be
     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
     duplicity in all this. i will endeavour to banish every painful
     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. let me hear
     from you very soon. miss bingley said something of his never
     returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
     with any certainty. we had better not mention it. i am extremely
     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
     hunsford. pray go to see them, with sir william and maria. i am
     sure you will be very comfortable there.

“yours, etc.”

this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. she would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions. his character sunk on every
review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr.
darcy’s sister, as, by wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.

mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else. elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
in charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.

all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner; and, after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:--“i am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil. but my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_, they are even impartial towards miss king. i cannot find
out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl. there can be no love in all this. my
watchfulness has been effectual; and though i should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were i distractedly in love
with him, i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance.
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do. they are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the
plain.”

with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did january and february pass away. march was to take
elizabeth to hunsford. she had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the
plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater
pleasure as well as greater certainty. absence had increased her desire
of seeing charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr. collins.
there was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. the journey would, moreover, give
her a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay. everything, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to charlotte’s first sketch. she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter. the improvement of
spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became as
perfect as plan could be.

the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.

the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more. his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,
whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing.

her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable. sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a
good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise. elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she had known sir william’s too long. he could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
worn out, like his information.

it was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch street by noon. as they drove to mr. gardiner’s
door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when
they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. all was joy and
kindness. the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute inquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection. it was reasonable, however, to
hope that they would not continue long. mrs. gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingley’s visit in gracechurch street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.

mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham’s desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.

“but, my dear elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is miss king? i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”

“pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary.”

“if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know
what to think.”

“she is a very good kind of girl, i believe. i know no harm of her.”

“but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death
made her mistress of this fortune?”

“no--why should he? if it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?”

“but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so
soon after this event.”

“a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. if _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?”

“_her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. it only shows her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”

“well,” cried elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _he_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”

“no, lizzy, that is what i do _not_ choose. i should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire.”

“oh, if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better. i am sick of them all. thank heaven! i am going to-morrow
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manners nor sense to recommend him. stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all.”

“take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”

before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

“we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said mrs.
gardiner; “but perhaps, to the lakes.”

no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “my dear, dear
aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! you give me
fresh life and vigour. adieu to disappointment and spleen. what are men
to rocks and mountains? oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! and
when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of anything. we _will_ know where
we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation. let _our_ first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.”

chapter xxviii.


[illustration]

every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in
search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side. elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

at length the parsonage was discernible. the garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving. mr. collins and charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other. mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. she saw
instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:
his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family. they were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were
in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s
offers of refreshment.

elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. but though
everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,
that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. when mr.
collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
charlotte. once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
charlotte wisely did not hear. after sitting long enough to admire
every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the
fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
happened in london, mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself. to work in his garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible. here, leading the way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. he could number the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump. but of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with
the prospect of rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that
bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. it was a
handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.

from his garden, mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows;
but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s
help. it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which
elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit. when mr. collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.

she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country. it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr. collins joining
in, observed,--

“yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will
be delighted with her. she is all affability and condescension, and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over. i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here. her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming. we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home. her ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. i
_should_ say, one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”

“lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added
charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”

“very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say. she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”

the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. she had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of mr. collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse
with rosings. a lively imagination soon settled it all.

about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. she opened
the door, and met maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,--

     “in conversation with the ladies”

[copyright 1894 by george allen.]]

“oh, my dear eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! i will not tell you what it is. make
haste, and come down this moment.”

elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more;
and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.

“and is this all?” cried elizabeth. “i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
daughter!”

“la! my dear,” said maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not lady
catherine. the old lady is mrs. jenkinson, who lives with them. the
other is miss de bourgh. only look at her. she is quite a little
creature. who would have thought she could be so thin and small!”

“she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
why does she not come in?”

“oh, charlotte says she hardly ever does. it is the greatest of favours
when miss de bourgh comes in.”

“i like her appearance,” said elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “she
looks sickly and cross. yes, she will do for him very well. she will
make him a very proper wife.”

mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth’s high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that
way.

at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house. mr. collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at rosings the next day.

chapter xxix.


[illustration]

mr. collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady
catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.

“i confess,” said he, “that i should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship’s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening
at rosings. i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that
it would happen. but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine
there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so
immediately after your arrival?”

“i am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied sir william,
“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. about the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”

scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to rosings. mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.

when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to
elizabeth,--

“do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and daughter. i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for anything more. lady catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed. she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.”

while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas,
who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her
introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at st. james’s.

as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park. every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost sir lewis de bourgh.

when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria’s alarm was every moment
increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm.
elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. she had heard nothing of lady
catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she
thought she could witness without trepidation.

from the entrance hall, of which mr. collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine,
her daughter, and mrs. jenkinson were sitting. her ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs. collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.

in spite of having been at st. james’s, sir william was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly. lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome. her air was not
conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank. she was not rendered formidable by
silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as
marked her self-importance, and brought mr. wickham immediately to
elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she
believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented.

when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in maria’s astonishment at her
being so thin and so small. there was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies. miss de bourgh was pale and sickly: her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to mrs. jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.

after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer.

the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater. he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;
and every dish was commended first by him, and then by sir william, who
was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a
manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear. but lady
catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most
gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty
to them. the party did not supply much conversation. elizabeth was ready
to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between
charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
the dinnertime. mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how
little miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and
fearing she was indisposed. maria thought speaking out of the question,
and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted. she inquired into charlotte’s domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry. elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an
occasion for dictating to others. in the intervals of her discourse with
mrs. collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who, she observed to mrs. collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. she asked her at different times how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother’s maiden name? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly. lady catherine then
observed,--

“your father’s estate is entailed on mr. collins, i think? for your
sake,” turning to charlotte, “i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourgh’s family. do you play and sing, miss
bennet?”

“a little.”

“oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it
some day. do your sisters play and sing?”

“one of them does.”

“why did not you all learn? you ought all to have learned. the miss
webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. do
you draw?”

“no, not at all.”

“what, none of you?”

“not one.”

“that is very strange. but i suppose you had no opportunity. your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”

“my mother would have no objection, but my father hates london.”

“has your governess left you?”

“we never had any governess.”

“no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home
without a governess! i never heard of such a thing. your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education.”

elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.

“then who taught you? who attended to you? without a governess, you must
have been neglected.”

“compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. we were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. those who chose to be
idle certainly might.”

“ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if i had
known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one. i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. it is
wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
way. i am always glad to get a young person well placed out. four nieces
of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day that i recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her. mrs. collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe’s
calling yesterday to thank me? she finds miss pope a treasure. ‘lady
catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ are any of your
younger sisters out, miss bennet?”

“yes, ma’am, all.”

“all! what, all five out at once? very odd! and you only the second. the
younger ones out before the elder are married! your younger sisters must
be very young?”

“yes, my youngest is not sixteen. perhaps _she_ is full young to be much
in company. but really, ma’am, i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early. the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first. and to be kept back on _such_ a motive! i think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”

“upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. pray, what is your age?”

“with three younger sisters grown up,” replied elizabeth, smiling, “your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”

lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

“you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age.”

“i am not one-and-twenty.”

when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed. lady catherine, sir william, and mr. and mrs. collins sat
down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her
party. their table was superlatively stupid. scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs. jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light. a great deal more passed at the
other table. lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. mr. collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.
sir william did not say much. he was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.

when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to mrs. collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. the party then gathered
round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. from these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr.
collins’s side, and as many bows on sir william’s, they departed. as
soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her
cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which,
for charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. but
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy mr. collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship’s
praise into his own hands.

chapter xxx.


[illustration]

sir william stayed only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with. while sir william was with them, mr. collins devoted his
mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but
when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in
reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,
which fronted the road. the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.

from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had
a few minutes’ conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.

very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. she examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that mrs. collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.

elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
mr. collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.

     “he never failed to inform them”

the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one
card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first. their other engagements were few, as the style of living
of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses’ reach. this,
however, was no evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors. her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine’s curiosity.

in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that mr. darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley’s designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by lady catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
miss lucas and herself.

his arrival was soon known at the parsonage; for mr. collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane,
in order to have

the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage
turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. on the
following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects. there were
two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for mr. darcy had brought
with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, lord ----;
and, to the great surprise of all the party, when mr. collins returned,
the gentlemen accompanied him. charlotte had seen them from her
husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the
other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--

“i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility. mr. darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.”

elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. colonel fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. mr. darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to mrs. collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. elizabeth merely
courtesied to him, without saying a word.

colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to mrs. collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family. she answered him in the usual
way; and, after a moment’s pause, added,--

“my eldest sister has been in town these three months. have you never
happened to see her there?”

she was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet. the
subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.

colonel fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at rosings. it was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. for the last week they had seen very little
of either lady catherine or her daughter. colonel fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr. darcy they had
only seen at church.

the invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in lady catherine’s drawing-room. her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.

colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a
welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs. collins’s pretty friend had,
moreover, caught his fancy very much. he now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as
well as of mr. darcy. _his_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,--

“what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam? what is it you are talking
of? what are you telling miss bennet? let me hear what it is.”

“we were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.

“of music! then pray speak aloud. it is of all subjects my delight. i
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.
there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true
enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. if i had ever
learnt, i should have been a great proficient. and so would anne, if her
health had allowed her to apply. i am confident that she would have
performed delightfully. how does georgiana get on, darcy?”

mr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.

“i am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said lady
catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal.”

“i assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.
she practises very constantly.”

“so much the better. it cannot be done too much; and when i next write
to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. i often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice. i have told miss bennet several times, that she will
never play really well, unless she practises more; and though mrs.
collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often told
her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in mrs.
jenkinson’s room. she would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part
of the house.”

mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made
no answer.

when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. he
drew a chair near her. lady catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s
countenance. elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--

“you mean to frighten me, mr. darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me. but i will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others. my courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me.”

“i shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,
are not your own.”

elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
colonel fitzwilliam, “your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word i say. i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit. indeed, mr. darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”

“i am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.

“pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried colonel
fitzwilliam. “i should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”

“you shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. the
first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know, was at
a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? he danced only four
dances! i am sorry to pain you, but so it was. he danced only four
dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more
than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. mr. darcy,
you cannot deny the fact.”

“i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party.”

“true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. well, colonel
fitzwilliam, what do i play next? my fingers wait your orders.”

“perhaps,” said darcy, “i should have judged better had i sought an
introduction, but i am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”

“shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said elizabeth, still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam. “shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?”

“i can answer your question,” said fitzwilliam, “without applying to
him. it is because he will not give himself the trouble.”

“i certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said darcy,
“of conversing easily with those i have never seen before. i cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as i often see done.”

“my fingers,” said elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many women’s do. they have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. but then i
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take
the trouble of practising. it is not that i do not believe _my_ fingers
as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”

darcy smiled and said, “you are perfectly right. you have employed your
time much better. no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. we neither of us perform to strangers.”

here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. elizabeth immediately began playing again.
lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to darcy,--

“miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a london master. she has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne’s. anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”

elizabeth looked at darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.

lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth’s performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship’s carriage was
ready to take them all home.

chapter xxxii.


[illustration]

elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane,
while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. as she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
lady catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise mr. darcy, and mr.
darcy only, entered the room.

he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.

they then sat down, and when her inquiries after rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. it was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,--

“how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr. darcy!
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day
before. he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london?”

“perfectly so, i thank you.”

she found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short
pause, added,--

“i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again?”

“i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future. he has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing.”

“if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there. but, perhaps, mr. bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle.”

“i should not be surprised,” said darcy, “if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.”

elizabeth made no answer. she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.

he took the hint and soon began with, “this seems a very comfortable
house. lady catherine, i believe, did a great deal to it when mr.
collins first came to hunsford.”

“i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.”

“mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”

“yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had. my friend has an excellent understanding--though
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest
thing she ever did. she seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”

“it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends.”

“an easy distance do you call it? it is nearly fifty miles.”

“and what is fifty miles of good road? little more than half a day’s
journey. yes, i call it a very easy distance.”

“i should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match,” cried elizabeth. “i should never have said mrs. collins
was settled _near_ her family.”

“it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire. anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far.”

as he spoke there was a sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--

“i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family. the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. where there is fortune to make the expense of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. but that is not the
case _here_. mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance.”

mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_you_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment. _you_ cannot have
been always at longbourn.”

elizabeth looked surprised. the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--

“are you pleased with kent?”

a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk. the _tête-à-tête_
surprised them. mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his
intruding on miss bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,
without saying much to anybody, went away.

[illustration: “accompanied by their aunt”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

“what can be the meaning of this?” said charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. “my dear eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
have called on us in this familiar way.”

but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year. all field sports were over. within doors there
was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. they called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt. it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former
favourite, george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there
was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam’s manners, she
believed he might have the best informed mind.

but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult
to understand. it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself. he seldom appeared really
animated. mrs. collins knew not what to make of him. colonel
fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love her friend eliza, she set herself
seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at
rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success. he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable. it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.

she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs.
collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.

in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam. he was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, mr. darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.




[illustration: “on looking up”]




chapter xxxiii.


[illustration]

more than once did elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet mr. darcy. she felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,
that it was a favourite haunt of hers. how it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! yet it did, and even the third. it seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. he
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
rencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her
pleasure in being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of mr. and mrs. collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of
rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying
_there_ too. his words seemed to imply it. could he have colonel
fitzwilliam in his thoughts? she supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. it distressed her
a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the parsonage.

she was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing jane’s last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy,
she saw, on looking up, that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her.
putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--

“i did not know before that you ever walked this way.”

“i have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as i generally
do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the parsonage.
are you going much farther?”

“no, i should have turned in a moment.”

and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage
together.

“do you certainly leave kent on saturday?” said she.

“yes--if darcy does not put it off again. but i am at his disposal. he
arranges the business just as he pleases.”

“and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice. i do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr. darcy.”

“he likes to have his own way very well,” replied colonel fitzwilliam.
“but so we all do. it is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. i speak
feelingly. a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence.”

“in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either. now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence? when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”

“these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature. but in matters of greater
weight, i may suffer from the want of money. younger sons cannot marry
where they like.”

“unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often
do.”

“our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money.”

“is this,” thought elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “and pray, what is
the usual price of an earl’s younger son? unless the elder brother is
very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”

he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,--

“i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal. i wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. but, perhaps, his sister does as well
for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her.”

“no,” said colonel fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must
divide with me. i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy.”

“are you, indeed? and pray what sort of a guardian do you make? does
your charge give you much trouble? young ladies of her age are sometimes
a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way.”

as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth. she directly replied,--

“you need not be frightened. i never heard any harm of her; and i dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs. hurst and
miss bingley. i think i have heard you say that you know them.”

“i know them a little. their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike
man--he is a great friend of darcy’s.”

“oh yes,” said elizabeth drily--“mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr.
bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”

“care of him! yes, i really believe darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care. from something that he told me
in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted
to him. but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose
that bingley was the person meant. it was all conjecture.”

“what is it you mean?”

“it is a circumstance which darcy of course could not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it
would be an unpleasant thing.”

“you may depend upon my not mentioning it.”

“and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley. what he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars; and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”

“did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”

“i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady.”

“and what arts did he use to separate them?”

“he did not talk to me of his own arts,” said fitzwilliam, smiling. “he
only told me what i have now told you.”

elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. after watching her a little, fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.

“i am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “your
cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. why was he to be the
judge?”

“you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”

“i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. but,”
she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. it is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case.”

“that is not an unnatural surmise,” said fitzwilliam; “but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”

this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
mr. darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage. there, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard. it was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. there
could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom mr. darcy could have
such boundless influence. that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate mr. bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them. if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that
jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. he had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.

“there were some very strong objections against the lady,” were colonel
fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in london.

“to jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of
objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. neither could
anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach.” when she thought
of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would
not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with mr.
darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining mr. bingley for his sister.

the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see mr. darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. mrs. collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but mr. collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine’s being rather
displeased by her staying at home.

chapter xxxiv.

when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against mr. darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent. they contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. mr. darcy’s
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a
keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. it was some consolation to
think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.

she could not think of darcy’s leaving kent without remembering that his
cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.

while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. but
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr. darcy walk into the
room. in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
she answered him with cold civility. he sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room. elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. after a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
in an agitated manner, and thus began:--

“in vain have i struggled. it will not do. my feelings will not be
repressed. you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you.”

elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. she stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. this he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately
followed. he spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the
heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of
tenderness than of pride. his sense of her inferiority, of its being a
degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed
to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the
consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit.

in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger. she tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done. he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of
all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand. as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a
favourable answer. he _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security. such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks
and she said,--

“in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. it is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if i could _feel_ gratitude, i would now thank you. but i
cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. i am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone. it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be
of short duration. the feelings which you tell me have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation.”

mr. darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise. his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature. he was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it. the pause was to elizabeth’s feelings
dreadful. at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--

“and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting! i
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, i am thus rejected. but it is of small importance.”

“i might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
was not this some excuse for incivility, if i _was_ uncivil? but i have
other provocations. you know i have. had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?”

as she pronounced these words, mr. darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued,--

“i have every reason in the world to think ill of you. no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. you dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind.”

she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.

“can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.

with assumed tranquillity he then replied, “i have no wish of denying
that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that i rejoice in my success. towards _him_ i have been
kinder than towards myself.”

elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

“but it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike
is founded. long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided. your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from mr. wickham. on this subject, what can you have to
say? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”

“you take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said darcy,
in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

“who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an
interest in him?”

“his misfortunes!” repeated darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his
misfortunes have been great indeed.”

“and of your infliction,” cried elizabeth, with energy; “you have
reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. you
have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed
for him. you have deprived the best years of his life of that
independence which was no less his due than his desert. you have done
all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with
contempt and ridicule.”

“and this,” cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
“is your opinion of me! this is the estimation in which you hold me! i
thank you for explaining it so fully. my faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! but, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my
being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything. but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related. they were natural and just.
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”

elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--

“you are mistaken, mr. darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the
concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.”

she saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--

“you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it.”

again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. she went on,--

“from the very beginning, from the first moment, i may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry.”

“you have said quite enough, madam. i perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness.”

and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house. the tumult of
her mind was now painfully great. she knew not how to support herself,
and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. her
astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by
every review of it. that she should receive an offer of marriage from
mr. darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections
which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which
must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost
incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong
an affection. but his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal
of what he had done with respect to jane, his unpardonable assurance in
acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner
which he had mentioned mr. wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not
attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his
attachment had for a moment excited.

she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady
catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.

chapter xxxv.


[illustration]

elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes. she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything
else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr. darcy’s
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. the
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.

after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees. she was on the point of continuing her
walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove
which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being
mr. darcy, she was directly retreating. but the person who advanced was
now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,
pronounced her name. she had turned away; but on hearing herself called,
though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy, she moved again
towards the gate. he had by that time reached it also; and, holding out
a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty
composure, “i have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of
meeting you. will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and
then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon
out of sight.

with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand. the envelope itself was likewise
full. pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. it was dated
from rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

“be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of
its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those
offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. i write without any
intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,
which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
and read. you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand
your attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i
demand it of your justice.

“two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. the first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached mr. bingley
from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in defiance of various
claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham. wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison. but from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope
to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and
their motives has been read. if, in the explanation of them which is due
to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be
offensive to yours, i can only say that i am sorry. the necessity must
be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. i had not been long in
hertfordshire before i saw, in common with others, that bingley
preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. but
it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any
apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. i had often seen him
in love before. at that ball, while i had the honour of dancing with
you, i was first made acquainted, by sir william lucas’s accidental
information, that bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to
a general expectation of their marriage. he spoke of it as a certain
event, of which the time alone could be undecided. from that moment i
observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive
that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed
in him. your sister i also watched. her look and manners were open,
cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar
regard; and i remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that
though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite
them by any participation of sentiment. if _you_ have not been mistaken
here, _i_ must have been in an error. your superior knowledge of your
sister must make the latter probable. if it be so, if i have been misled
by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
unreasonable. but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of
your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most
acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart
was not likely to be easily touched. that i was desirous of believing
her indifferent is certain; but i will venture to say that my
investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or
fears. i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it; i
believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason.
my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night
acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside
in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
my friend as to me. but there were other causes of repugnance; causes
which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both
instances, i had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not
immediately before me. these causes must be stated, though briefly. the
situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in
comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost
uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and
occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend
you. but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,
and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid
any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on
you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and
disposition of both. i will only say, farther, that from what passed
that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every
inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my
friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection. he left
netherfield for london on the day following, as you, i am certain,
remember, with the design of soon returning. the part which i acted is
now to be explained. his sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited
with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike
sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we
shortly resolved on joining him directly in london. we accordingly
went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my
friend the certain evils of such a choice. i described and enforced them
earnestly. but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed
his determination, i do not suppose that it would ultimately have
prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which
i hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. he had before
believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,
regard. but bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger
dependence on my judgment than on his own. to convince him, therefore,
that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. to persuade
him against returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been
given, was scarcely the work of a moment. i cannot blame myself for
having done thus much. there is but one part of my conduct, in the whole
affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that i
condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him
your sister’s being in town. i knew it myself, as it was known to miss
bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. that they might
have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard
did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some
danger. perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. it is
done, however, and it was done for the best. on this subject i have
nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. if i have wounded your
sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have not
yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other, more weighty
accusation, of having injured mr. wickham, i can only refute it by
laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. of what he
has _particularly_ accused me i am ignorant; but of the truth of what i
shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.
mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years
the management of all the pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in
the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service
to him; and on george wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was
therefore liberally bestowed. my father supported him at school, and
afterwards at cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,
always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to
give him a gentleman’s education. my father was not only fond of this
young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the
highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,
intended to provide for him in it. as for myself, it is many, many years
since i first began to think of him in a very different manner. the
vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to
guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the
observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who
had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr. darcy
could not have. here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you
only can tell. but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has
created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding
his real character. it adds even another motive. my excellent father
died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the
last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to
promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might
allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living
might be his as soon as it became vacant. there was also a legacy of
one thousand pounds. his own father did not long survive mine; and
within half a year from these events mr. wickham wrote to inform me
that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped i should
not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate
pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
benefited. he had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and i
must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very
insufficient support therein. i rather wished than believed him to be
sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his
proposal. i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman. the
business was therefore soon settled. he resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. all connection
between us seemed now dissolved. i thought too ill of him to invite him
to pemberley, or admit his society in town. in town, i believe, he
chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being
now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and
dissipation. for about three years i heard little of him; but on the
decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,
he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. his
circumstances, he assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it,
were exceedingly bad. he had found the law a most unprofitable study,
and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would present
him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little
doubt, as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for,
and i could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. you will
hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
resisting every repetition of it. his resentment was in proportion to
the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in
his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. after this
period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. how he lived, i
know not. but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my
notice. i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget
myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me
to unfold to any human being. having said thus much, i feel no doubt of
your secrecy. my sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left
to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, colonel fitzwilliam, and
myself. about a year ago, she was taken from school, and an
establishment formed for her in london; and last summer she went with
the lady who presided over it to ramsgate; and thither also went mr.
wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior
acquaintance between him and mrs. younge, in whose character we were
most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far
recommended himself to georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a
strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was
persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. she
was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to
herself. i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended
elopement; and then georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving
and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,
acknowledged the whole to me. you may imagine what i felt and how i
acted. regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public
exposure; but i wrote to mr. wickham, who left the place immediately,
and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge. mr. wickham’s
chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty
thousand pounds; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging
himself on me was a strong inducement. his revenge would have been
complete indeed. this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in
which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely
reject it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
towards mr. wickham. i know not in what manner, under what form of
falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be
wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning
either. detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly
not in your inclination. you may possibly wonder why all this was not
told you last night. but i was not then master enough of myself to know
what could or ought to be revealed. for the truth of everything here
related, i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel
fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and
still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been
unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. if
your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you
cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and
that there may be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour
to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the
course of the morning. i will only add, god bless you.

“fitzwilliam darcy.”

chapter xxxvi.


[illustration]

elizabeth, when mr. darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. with a strong
prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at netherfield. she read with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes. his belief of her sister’s
insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the
real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any
wish of doing him justice. he expressed no regret for what he had done
which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. it was all
pride and insolence.

but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham--when
she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. she wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “this must be false!
this cannot be! this must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.

in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words. so far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to
the will, the difference was great. what wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. but when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of wickham’s resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. she put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success. on both sides it was only assertion. again she read on.
but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render mr. darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
mr. wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice. she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told

himself. as to his real character, had information been in her power,
she had never felt a wish of inquiring. his countenance, voice, and
manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished
trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the
attacks of mr. darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone
for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what
mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’
continuance. but no such recollection befriended her. she could see him
instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could
remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the
neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in
the mess. after pausing on this point a considerable while, she once
more continued to read. but, alas! the story which followed, of his
designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed
between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at
last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel
fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the
information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose
character she had no reason to question. at one time she had almost
resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness
of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that
mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been
well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.

she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr. philips’s.
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. she was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before. she saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct. she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing mr. darcy--that mr. darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week. she remembered, also, that till the netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;
that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr. darcy’s
character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son.

how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! his
attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown. every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in further justification of mr. darcy, she could not
but allow that mr. bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued;--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his
actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man
as mr. bingley was incomprehensible.

she grew absolutely ashamed of herself. of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.

“how despicably have i acted!” she cried. “i, who have prided myself on
my discernment! i, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity in useless or blameless distrust. how humiliating is this
discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! had i been in love, i could not
have been more wretchedly blind. but vanity, not love, has been my
folly. pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were
concerned. till this moment, i never knew myself.”

from herself to jane, from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy’s explanation
_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. how could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious
of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what
charlotte’s opinion had always been. neither could she deny the justice
of his description of jane. she felt that jane’s feelings, though
fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant
complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.

when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.

the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. it soothed, but
it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that
jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before.

after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and
reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so
important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at
length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing
cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as
must make her unfit for conversation.

she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during her absence; mr. darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found. elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it. colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object. she could think only of her letter.

“his parting obeisance”
]




chapter xxxvii.


[illustration]

the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr. collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings. to rosings he then
hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter; and on his return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.

elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that, had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship’s indignation would have been. “what would she have said? how
would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused
herself.

their first subject was the diminution of the rosings’ party. “i assure
you, i feel it exceedingly,” said lady catherine; “i believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as i do. but i am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!
they were excessively sorry to go! but so they always are. the dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely--more, i think, than last year. his
attachment to rosings certainly increases.”

mr. collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--

“but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer. mrs. collins will be very glad of your
company, i am sure.”

“i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied
elizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. i must be in town
next saturday.”

“why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. i expected
you to stay two months. i told mrs. collins so before you came. there
can be no occasion for your going so soon. mrs. bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight.”

“but my father cannot. he wrote last week to hurry my return.”

[illustration:

“dawson”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

“oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. and if you will
stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you
as far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and
as dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good
room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be
cool, i should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you
large.”

“you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our
original plan.”

lady catherine seemed resigned. “mrs. collins, you must send a servant
with them. you know i always speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves. it is highly improper.
you must contrive to send somebody. i have the greatest dislike in the
world to that sort of thing. young women should always be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. when my
niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her
having two men-servants go with her. miss darcy, the daughter of mr.
darcy of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. i am excessively attentive to all those
things. you must send john with the young ladies, mrs. collins. i am
glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”

“my uncle is to send a servant for us.”

“oh! your uncle! he keeps a man-servant, does he? i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things. where shall you change horses?
oh, bromley, of course. if you mention my name at the bell, you will be
attended to.”

lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;
and as she did not answer them all herself attention was
necessary--which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a
mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. reflection
must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave
way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a
solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of
unpleasant recollections.

mr. darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. she
studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. when she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. in her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in
the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
they were hopeless of remedy. her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under lydia’s guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing. they were ignorant, idle, and vain. while
there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.

anxiety on jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and mr. darcy’s
explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion,
heightened the sense of what jane had lost. his affection was proved to
have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. how
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!

when to these recollections was added the development of wickham’s
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first. the very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year;
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out
her hand to both.

chapter xxxviii.


[illustration]

on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

“i know not, miss elizabeth,” said he, “whether mrs. collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you. we know
how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending
your time unpleasantly.”

elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. she had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel
the obliged. mr. collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,--

“it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably. we have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that
your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. our situation
with regard to lady catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. you see on
what a footing we are. you see how continually we are engaged there. in
truth, i must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this
humble parsonage, i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings.”

words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.

“you may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
hertfordshire, my dear cousin. i flatter myself, at least, that you will
be able to do so. lady catherine’s great attentions to mrs. collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent. only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth,
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking. there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. we seem to have been designed for each
other.”

elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. she was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprang. poor charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such
society! but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently
regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for
compassion. her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,
and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. after an affectionate
parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr. collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner, though unknown. he then handed
her in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings.

[illustration:

“they had forgotten to leave any message”
]

“but,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here.”

elizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.

“good gracious!” cried maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!”

“a great many indeed,” said her companion, with a sigh.

“we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
how much i shall have to tell!”

elizabeth privately added, “and how much i shall have to conceal!”

their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr. gardiner’s
house, where they were to remain a few days.

jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them. but jane was to go home with her, and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

it was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
longbourn, before she told her sister of mr. darcy’s proposals. to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister
further.

     “how nicely we are crammed in”

chapter xxxix.


[illustration]

it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch street for the town of ----, in hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet’s carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s
punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.
these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.

after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
“is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”

“and we mean to treat you all,” added lydia; “but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” then showing
her purchases,--“look here, i have bought this bonnet. i do not think it
is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not. i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any
better.”

and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, “oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i
think it will be very tolerable. besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight.”

“are they, indeed?” cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

“they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! it would be such a delicious scheme,
and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all. mamma would like to
go, too, of all things! only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!”

“yes,” thought elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once. good heaven! brighton and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton!”

“now i have got some news for you,” said lydia, as they sat down to
table. “what do you think? it is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like.”

jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay. lydia laughed, and said,--

“ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. you thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say. but he is an ugly fellow! i am glad
he is gone. i never saw such a long chin in my life. well, but now for
my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?
there is no danger of wickham’s marrying mary king--there’s for you! she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay. wickham is safe.”

“and mary king is safe!” added elizabeth; “safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.”

“she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”

“but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said jane.

“i am sure there is not on _his_. i will answer for it, he never cared
three straws about her. who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled
thing?”

elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!

as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty’s and
lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.

“how nicely we are crammed in!” cried lydia. “i am glad i brought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. have you seen any pleasant men? have you had any
flirting? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.
she is almost three-and-twenty! lord! how ashamed i should be of not
being married before three-and-twenty! my aunt philips wants you so to
get husbands you can’t think. she says lizzy had better have taken mr.
collins; but _i_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. lord!
how i should like to be married before any of you! and then i would
_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forster’s! kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and mrs. forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by-the-bye, mrs. forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two harringtons to come: but harriet was ill, and so pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? we
dressed up chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun! not a soul knew of it, but colonel and mrs.
forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! when denny,
and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least. lord! how i laughed! and so did mrs.
forster. i thought i should have died. and _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”

with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia,
assisted by kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn. elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham’s name.

their reception at home was most kind. mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet
say voluntarily to elizabeth,----

“i am glad you are come back, lizzy.”

their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects
which occupied them: lady lucas was inquiring of maria, across the
table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs. bennet
was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.

“oh, mary,” said she, “i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if
kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too. and then when we came away it was such fun! i thought
we never should have got into the coach. i was ready to die of laughter.
and then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so
loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”

to this, mary very gravely replied, “far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures. they would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds. but i confess they would have no charms for
_me_. i should infinitely prefer a book.”

but of this answer lydia heard not a word. she seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all.

in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
meryton, and see how everybody went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme. it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. there was
another reason, too, for her opposition. she dreaded seeing wickham
again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. the comfort to
_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond
expression. in a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.

she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton
scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.

chapter xl.


[illustration]

elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr.
darcy and herself.

miss bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. she was
sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.

“his being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment.”

“indeed,” replied elizabeth, “i am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”

“blame you! oh, no.”

“but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham?”

“no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”

“but you _will_ know it, when i have told you what happened the very
next day.”

she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham. what a stroke was this for poor jane,
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here
collected in one individual! nor was darcy’s vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.

“this will not do,” said elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr.
darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”

it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane.

“i do not know when i have been more shocked,” said she. “wickham so
very bad! it is almost past belief. and poor mr. darcy! dear lizzy,
only consider what he must have suffered. such a disappointment! and
with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a
thing of his sister! it is really too distressing, i am sure you must
feel it so.”

“oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full
of both. i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing
every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. your profusion makes me
saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as
light as a feather.”

“poor wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.”

“there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. one has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it.”

“i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do.”

“and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. it is such a spur to one’s genius, such an
opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. one may be continually
abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”

“lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now.”

“indeed, i could not. i was uncomfortable enough, i was very
uncomfortable--i may say unhappy. and with no one to speak to of what i
felt, no jane to comfort me, and say that i had not been so very weak,
and vain, and nonsensical, as i knew i had! oh, how i wanted you!”

“how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved.”

“certainly. but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging. there is
one point on which i want your advice. i want to be told whether i
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand
wickham’s character.”

miss bennet paused a little, and then replied, “surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. what is your own opinion?”

“that it ought not to be attempted. mr. darcy has not authorized me to
make his communication public. on the contrary, every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct, who will believe me? the general prejudice against mr. darcy is
so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. i am not equal to
it. wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to
anybody here what he really is. some time hence it will be all found
out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.
at present i will say nothing about it.”

“you are quite right. to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. he is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character. we must not make him desperate.”

the tumult of elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. she
had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a
fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she
might wish to talk again of either. but there was still something
lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. she dared not
relate the other half of mr. darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister
how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. here was knowledge in
which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than
a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in
throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “and then,” said she, “if
that very improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be
able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner
himself. the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost
all its value!”

she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister’s spirits. jane was not happy. she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley. having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.

“well, lizzy,” said mrs. bennet, one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of jane’s? for my part, i am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. i told my sister philips so the other day. but i
cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london. well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. there is no talk of his
coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know.”

[illustration:

     “i am determined never to speak of it again”
]

“i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more.”

“oh, well! it is just as he chooses. nobody wants him to come; though i
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if i was
her, i would not have put up with it. well, my comfort is, i am sure
jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done.”

but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she
made no answer.

“well, lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the
collinses live very comfortable, do they? well, well, i only hope it
will last. and what sort of table do they keep? charlotte is an
excellent manager, i dare say. if she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough. there is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, i dare say.”

“no, nothing at all.”

“a great deal of good management, depend upon it. yes, yes. _they_ will
take care not to outrun their income. _they_ will never be distressed
for money. well, much good may it do them! and so, i suppose, they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead. they look upon it
quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens.”

“it was a subject which they could not mention before me.”

“no; it would have been strange if they had. but i make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves. well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. _i_ should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”

“when colonel miller’s regiment went away”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]




chapter xli.


[illustration]

the first week of their return was soon gone. the second began. it was
the last of the regiment’s stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace. the dejection was almost
universal. the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.

“good heaven! what is to become of us? what are we to do?” would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “how can you be smiling so,
lizzy?”

their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.

“i am sure,” said she, “i cried for two days together when colonel
miller’s regiment went away. i thought i should have broke my heart.”

“i am sure i shall break _mine_,” said lydia.

“if one could but go to brighton!” observed mrs. bennet.

“oh yes!--if one could but go to brighton! but papa is so disagreeable.”

“a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”

“and my aunt philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”
added kitty.

such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn house. elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy’s
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.

but the gloom of lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from mrs. forster, the wife of the colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to brighton. this invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. a resemblance in good-humour
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs. forster,
the delight of mrs. bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely
to be described. wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

“i cannot see why mrs. forster should not ask _me_ as well as lydia,”
said she, “though i am _not_ her particular friend. i have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older.”

in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make
her resigned. as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go. she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia’s general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as mrs. forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. he heard her attentively, and then said,--

“lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances.”

“if you were aware,” said elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia’s unguarded and
imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you
would judge differently in the affair.”

“already arisen!” repeated mr. bennet. “what! has she frightened away
some of your lovers? poor little lizzy! but do not be cast down. such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret. come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by lydia’s folly.”

“indeed, you are mistaken. i have no such injuries to resent. it is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining. our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydia’s character. excuse me,--for i must speak plainly. if you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. her character
will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. in this danger kitty
is also comprehended. she will follow wherever lydia leads. vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! oh, my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?”

mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,
affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--

“do not make yourself uneasy, my love. wherever you and jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three--very silly
sisters. we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton. let her go, then. colonel forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody. at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here. the officers will find
women better worth their notice. let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. at any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life.”

with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. it was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.
she was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.

had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. in lydia’s imagination, a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. she saw, with the creative eye
of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown. she saw all the glories of the camp: its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.

[illustration:

“tenderly flirting”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? they could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same. lydia’s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband’s never intending to go there
himself.

but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued, with little intermission, to the very day of lydia’s leaving
home.

elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time. having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. she had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. in his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her. she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.

on the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in meryton, he dined,
with others of the officers, at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliam’s and mr. darcy’s having both spent three
weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.

he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s
recollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
asked her how she had liked him. her answer was warmly in his favour.
with an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “how long did you
say that he was at rosings?”

“nearly three weeks.”

“and you saw him frequently?”

“yes, almost every day.”

“his manners are very different from his cousin’s.”

“yes, very different; but i think mr. darcy improves on acquaintance.”

“indeed!” cried wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “and pray
may i ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “is it in
address that he improves? has he deigned to add aught of civility to his
ordinary style? for i dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more
serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”

“oh, no!” said elizabeth. “in essentials, i believe, he is very much
what he ever was.”

while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,--

“when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,
from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”

wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,--

“you, who so well know my feelings towards mr. darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right. his pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by. i only fear that
the sort of cautiousness to which you, i imagine, have been alluding, is
merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe. his fear of her has always operated, i
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he
has very much at heart.”

elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. the rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.

when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. mrs.
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous
happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.

gardiners

chapter xlii.


[illustration]

had elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown. but mr. bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. he was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.

elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father’s behaviour as a husband. she had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible. but she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.

when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham’s departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked
forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in the
scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

“but it is fortunate,” thought she, “that i have something to wish for.
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister’s absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized. a scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”

when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short. those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as mrs. forster called her, and they were going to the
camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less
to be learnt, for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.

after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,
good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn. everything
wore a happier aspect. the families who had been in town for the winter
came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. mrs.
bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle
of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton
without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth
hope, that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably
reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by
some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office, another regiment
should be quartered in meryton.

the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from mrs. gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire. in that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. the
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock, chatsworth,
dovedale, or the peak.

elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. but it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.

with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
owner. “but surely,” said she, “i may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”

the period of expectation was now doubled. four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. but they did pass away, and mr. and
mrs. gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
longbourn. the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn, and set off the next
morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. one
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.

it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay--oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenilworth, birmingham, etc., are
sufficiently known. a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern. to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs. gardiner’s
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
lambton, elizabeth found, from her aunt, that pemberley was situated. it
was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. in
talking over their route the evening before, mrs. gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again. mr. gardiner declared his
willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.

“my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much?” said her aunt. “a place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected. wickham passed all his youth there, you
know.”

elizabeth was distressed. she felt that she had no business at
pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. she
must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.

mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity. “if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished,” said she, “i should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful. they have some of the finest woods in the
country.”

elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. the
possibility of meeting mr. darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred. it would be dreadful! she blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such
a risk. but against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered.

accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer? a most welcome negative followed the last question; and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme.

to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.

chapter xliii.


[illustration]

elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. they
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.

elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. they gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound. it was a large, handsome stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. elizabeth was delighted. she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. they were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of pemberley might be something!

they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.

the housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. they
followed her into the dining-parlour. it was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. the hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object. every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight. as they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties
to be seen. the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture
suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with
admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly
fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the
furniture of rosings.

“and of this place,” thought she, “i might have been mistress! with
these rooms i might have now been familiarly acquainted! instead of
viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. but, no,” recollecting
herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me; i should not have been allowed to invite them.”

this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.

she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it. at length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs. reynolds
replied, that he was; adding, “but we expect him to-morrow, with a large
party of friends.” how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had
not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

her aunt now called her to look at a picture. she approached, and saw
the likeness of mr. wickham, suspended, amongst several other
miniatures, over the mantel-piece. her aunt asked her, smilingly, how
she liked it. the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the
picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who
had been brought up by him at his own expense. “he is now gone into the
army,” she added; “but i am afraid he has turned out very wild.”

mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but elizabeth could not
return it.

“and that,” said mrs. reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
“is my master--and very like him. it was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago.”

“i have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said mrs. gardiner,
looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. but, lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not.”

mrs. reynolds’ respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.

“does that young lady know mr. darcy?”

elizabeth coloured, and said, “a little.”

“and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”

“yes, very handsome.”

“i am sure _i_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. this room was my late
master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then. he was very fond of them.”

this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickham’s being among them.

mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.

“and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother?” said mr. gardiner.

“oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished! she plays and sings all day long. in the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she
comes here to-morrow with him.”

mr. gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks: mrs. reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.

“is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?”

“not so much as i could wish, sir: but i dare say he may spend half his
time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months.”

“except,” thought elizabeth, “when she goes to ramsgate.”

“if your master would marry, you might see more of him.”

“yes, sir; but i do not know when _that_ will be. i do not know who is
good enough for him.”

mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled. elizabeth could not help saying, “it is
very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so.”

“i say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows
him,” replied the other. elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
“i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him
ever since he was four years old.”

this was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. that he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was
grateful to her uncle for saying,--

“there are very few people of whom so much can be said. you are lucky in
having such a master.”

“yes, sir, i know i am. if i were to go through the world, i could not
meet with a better. but i have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
world.”

elizabeth almost stared at her. “can this be mr. darcy?” thought she.

“his father was an excellent man,” said mrs. gardiner.

“yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor.”

elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. mrs.
reynolds could interest her on no other point. she related the subjects
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture in vain. mr. gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

“he is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever
lived. not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves. there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name. some people call him proud; but i am sure i never
saw anything of it. to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men.”

“in what an amiable light does this place him!” thought elizabeth.

“this fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”

“perhaps we might be deceived.”

“that is not very likely; our authority was too good.”

on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when
last at pemberley.

“he is certainly a good brother,” said elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.

mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy’s delight, when she should enter
the room. “and this is always the way with him,” she added. “whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. there
is nothing he would not do for her.”

the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shown. in the former were many good paintings:
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.

in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her. at last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr. darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her. she stood several minutes before the picture, in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery. mrs. reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father’s lifetime.

there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance. the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds
was of no trifling nature. what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant? as a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! how
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! how much of good
or evil must be done by him! every idea that had been brought forward by
the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before
the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon
herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude
than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened
its impropriety of expression.

when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.

as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.

they were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush. he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.

she had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw mr. darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil inquiries after her family. amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life. nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay
in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.

at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.

the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence. she was overpowered by shame and
vexation. her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world! how strange must it appear to him! in what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! it might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! oh! why did she come?
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. she blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting. and his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean? that he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her
family! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park, when
he put his letter into her hand! she knew not what to think, or how to
account for it.

they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr. darcy then
was. she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
she was still dear to him. perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was
not like ease. whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.

at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

they entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. mr. gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk. with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round. it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.
they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it. elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs. gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for mr. gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little. whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth’s astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr. darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. the walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met. elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. for a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. the idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them. with a glance she saw that
he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,
she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not
got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky
recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of pemberley from
her might be mischievously construed. her colour changed, and she said
no more.

mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself. “what will be his surprise,” thought
she, “when he knows who they are! he takes them now for people of
fashion.”

the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions. that he was _surprised_ by the
connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,
so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with mr. gardiner. elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. it was consoling that he should know she had some
relations for whom there was no need to blush. she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.

the conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard mr. darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. mrs. gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder. elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself. her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, “why is he so altered? from
what can it proceed? it cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his manners are thus softened. my reproofs at hunsford could not
work such a change as this. it is impossible that he should still love
me.”

after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. it originated in
mrs. gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband’s. mr. darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. after a short silence the lady first spoke. she wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we
left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country.” he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “they
will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr. bingley and his sisters.”

elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when mr. bingley’s name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was
not very differently engaged.

“there is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a
pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. will you allow
me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at lambton?”

the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.

they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased. his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind. they soon outstripped the others; and when they had
reached the carriage, mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.

he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. at such a time much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward. she wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject. at last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dovedale with
great perseverance. yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.

on mr. and mrs. gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into
the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they
parted on each side with the utmost politeness. mr. darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house.

the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.

“he is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.

“there _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her
aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. i can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
_i_ have seen nothing of it.”

“i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. it was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention. his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling.”

“to be sure, lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as wickham;
or rather he has not wickham’s countenance, for his features are
perfectly good. but how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?”

elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked
him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.

“but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied
her uncle. “your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds.”

elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.

“from what we have seen of him,” continued mrs. gardiner, “i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor wickham. he has not an ill-natured look.
on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks. and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. but, to be sure, the
good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. but he is a liberal
master, i suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends
every virtue.”

elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire. in
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
anything else. fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.

the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of mr. darcy’s civility, and, above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.

elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was, consequently,
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at lambton these visitors came. they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle driving up the street. elizabeth, immediately recognizing the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected. her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business. nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. while these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. she was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.

miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. since her
being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy. she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.

miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful. she was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle. elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.

they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley’s quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. all
elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. he
inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and
looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.

to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself. they had long wished to see him. the whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. the suspicions which had just
arisen of mr. darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love. of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.

elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom
she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.
bingley was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be
pleased.

     “to make herself agreeable to all”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a
like manner. sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. but,
though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival to jane. no
look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. nothing
occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. on
this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances
occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted
a recollection of jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of
saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. he
observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and
in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long
time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could
reply, he added, “it is above eight months. we have not met since the
26th of november, when we were all dancing together at netherfield.”

elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
_all_ her sisters were at longbourn. there was not much in the question,
nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning.

it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself; but
whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her
that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,
however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one
day. when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the
good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would
have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,
but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected
their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the
change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could
hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. never, even in the
company of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations
at rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
rosings.

their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose
to depart, mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner
at pemberley, before they left the country. miss darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed. mrs. gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head. presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends. elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and
on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been
little. eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner’s curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication. it was evident that she was
much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. they saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.

of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. they could
not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for mr. darcy. there was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. they had
nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town
where the family did not visit. it was acknowledged, however, that he
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which mr. darcy afterwards discharged.

as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. she
certainly did not hate him. no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called. the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. but above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be
overlooked. it was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. he who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and
without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,
where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good
opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. such
a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as
such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no
means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. she respected,
she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.

it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as miss darcy’s, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning. they were, therefore, to go. elizabeth was pleased; though when
she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast. the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.

convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley’s dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know
with how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now
be renewed.

on reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. its windows,
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there
with mrs. hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
london. georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. mrs. gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.

by mrs. hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. it was first broken by mrs. annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
others; and between her and mrs. gardiner, with occasional help from
elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.

elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without
calling her attention. this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she
feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss
bingley’s voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family. she answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post. there was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.

while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.

he had been some time with mr. gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning. no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room. in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley’s, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to mr. darcy were by no means over. miss darcy, on her brother’s
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. miss
bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--

“pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?
they must be a great loss to _your_ family.”

in darcy’s presence she dared not mention wickham’s name: but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. while
she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with
that corps. not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy’s
meditated elopement. to no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley’s connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. he had certainly formed such a plan; and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.

elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.

their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage,
miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth’s
person, behaviour, and dress. but georgiana would not join her. her
brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment
could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave
georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and
amiable. when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley could not help
repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.

“how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr. darcy,” she cried: “i
never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.
she is grown so brown and coarse! louisa and i were agreeing that we
should not have known her again.”

however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.

“for my own part,” she rejoined, “i must confess that i never could see
any beauty in her. her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines. her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive anything
extraordinary in them. they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable.”

persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected. he was resolutely silent, however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,--

“i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, ‘_she_
a beauty! i should as soon call her mother a wit.’ but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time.”

“yes,” replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_
was only when i first knew her; for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”

he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.

mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
both. the looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. they talked
of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but
himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of
him, and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s
beginning the subject.

chapter xlvi.


[illustration]

elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
jane on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on
the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been mis-sent elsewhere. elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. the one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago. the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. it was to this effect:--

“since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming you--be
assured that we are all well. what i have to say relates to poor lydia.
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland
with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham! imagine our
surprise. to kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. i am
very, very sorry. so imprudent a match on both sides! but i am willing
to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him, but this step (and
let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. his choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
our poor mother is sadly grieved. my father bears it better. how
thankful am i, that we never let them know what has been said against
him; we must forget it ourselves. they were off saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight. the express was sent off directly. my dear lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. colonel forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon. lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
their intention. i must conclude, for i cannot be long from my poor
mother. i am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but i hardly
know what i have written.”

without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.

“by this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; i
wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent. dearest
lizzy, i hardly know what i would write, but i have bad news for you,
and it cannot be delayed. imprudent as a marriage between mr. wickham
and our poor lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to scotland. colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the
day before, not many hours after the express. though lydia’s short
letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to gretna
green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w.
never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which was repeated
to colonel f., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from b.,
intending to trace their route. he did trace them easily to clapham, but
no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a
hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom.
all that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the
london road. i know not what to think. after making every possible
inquiry on that side london, colonel f. came on into hertfordshire,
anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in barnet
and hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to
pass through. with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn, and
broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f.; but no one can throw any
blame on them. our distress, my dear lizzy, is very great. my father and
mother believe the worst, but i cannot think so ill of him. many
circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married
privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_
could form such a design against a young woman of lydia’s connections,
which is not likely, can i suppose her so lost to everything?
impossible! i grieve to find, however, that colonel f. is not disposed
to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when i expressed my
hopes, and said he feared w. was not a man to be trusted. my poor mother
is really ill, and keeps her room. could she exert herself, it would be
better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in
my life saw him so affected. poor kitty has anger for having concealed
their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot
wonder. i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared
something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is
over, shall i own that i long for your return? i am not so selfish,
however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. adieu! i take up my pen
again to do, what i have just told you i would not; but circumstances
are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as
soon as possible. i know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that i am not
afraid of requesting it, though i have still something more to ask of
the former. my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly,
to try to discover her. what he means to do, i am sure i know not; but
his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the
best and safest way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton
again to-morrow evening. in such an exigence my uncle’s advice and
assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately
comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness.”

“oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and mr. darcy appeared. her pale face and
impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself
enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia’s
situation, hastily exclaimed, “i beg your pardon, but i must leave you.
i must find mr. gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;
i have not an instant to lose.”

“good god! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, “i will not detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the servant, go after mr. and mrs. gardiner. you are
not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”

elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly.

on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
“let me call your maid. is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief? a glass of wine; shall i get you one? you are very ill.”

“no, i thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “there
is nothing the matter with me. i am quite well, i am only distressed by
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn.”

she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his

[illustration:

     “i have not an instant to lose”
]

concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. at length she spoke
again. “i have just had a letter from jane, with such dreadful news. it
cannot be concealed from anyone. my youngest sister has left all her
friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of mr.
wickham. they are gone off together from brighton. _you_ know him too
well to doubt the rest. she has no money, no connections, nothing that
can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”

darcy was fixed in astonishment.

“when i consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _i_
might have prevented it! _i_ who knew what he was. had i but explained
some part of it only--some part of what i learnt, to my own family! had
his character been known, this could not have happened. but it is all,
all too late now.”

“i am grieved, indeed,” cried darcy: “grieved--shocked. but is it
certain, absolutely certain?”

“oh, yes! they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced
almost to london, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to
scotland.”

“and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”

“my father has gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle’s
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour. but
nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done. how is
such a man to be worked on? how are they even to be discovered? i have
not the smallest hope. it is every way horrible!”

darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.

“when _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had i known what
i ought, what i dared to do! but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too
much. wretched, wretched mistake!”

darcy made no answer. he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. her power
was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. she could neither
wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. it
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.

but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. lydia--the
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--

“i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i anything
to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.
would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,
that might offer consolation to such distress! but i will not torment
you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
this unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister’s having the
pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day.”

“oh, yes! be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy. say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible. i know it cannot be long.”

he readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with
only one serious parting look, went away.

as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth’s
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. but if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham,
and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what lydia’s infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business. never since reading jane’s second letter had she entertained a
hope of wickham’s meaning to marry her. no one but jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. surprise was the least
of all her feelings on this development. while the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,
that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money; and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible. but now it was all too natural. for such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.

she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that
lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. sometimes one
officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion. her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object. the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now
feel it!

she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience
was severe. mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last with trembling energy. though lydia had never
been a favourite with them, mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be
deeply affected. not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr. gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power. elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily
settled. they were to be off as soon as possible. “but what is to be
done about pemberley?” cried mrs. gardiner. “john told us mr. darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?”

“yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
_that_ is all settled.”

“what is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. “and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth? oh, that i knew how it was!”

but wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr.
gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn.

“i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter. it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form
such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel’s family, that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best. could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster? his temptation is
not adequate to the risk.”

“do you really think so?” cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.

“upon my word,” said mrs. gardiner, “i begin to be of your uncle’s
opinion. it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it. i cannot think so very ill of
wickham. can you, yourself, lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?”

“not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. but of every other neglect
i can believe him capable. if, indeed, it should be so! but i dare not
hope it. why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the
case?”

“in the first place,” replied mr. gardiner, “there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to scotland.”

“oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a
presumption! and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
barnet road.”

“well, then,--supposing them to be in london--they may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland.”

“but why all this secrecy? why any fear of detection? why must their
marriage be private? oh, no, no--this is not likely. his most particular
friend, you see by jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. wickham will never marry a woman without some money. he
cannot afford it. and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? as to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. but as to your
other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good. lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter.”

“but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”

“it does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. but, really, i know not what to say.
perhaps i am not doing her justice. but she is very young: she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. she has been doing
everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall i call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which
are naturally lively enough. and we all know that wickham has every
charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”

“but you see that jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of
wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”

“of whom does jane ever think ill? and who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them? but jane knows, as well as i do, what
wickham really is. we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”

“and do you really know all this?” cried mrs. gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.

“i do, indeed,” replied elizabeth, colouring. “i told you the other day
of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with
such forbearance and liberality towards him. and there are other
circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless. from
what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. yet he knew to the contrary himself. he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her.”

“but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand?”

“oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. till i was in kent, and saw
so much both of mr. darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam, i was
ignorant of the truth myself. and when i returned home the ----shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. as that was the
case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? and even when it
was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. that _she_ could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. that such a
consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts.”

“when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i
suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”

“not the slightest. i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. when first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were. every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular
attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”

it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey. from elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could
find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day. it was a comfort
to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long
expectations.

the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running downstairs from
her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.

elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives.

“not yet,” replied jane. “but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope
everything will be well.”

“is my father in town?”

“yes, he went on tuesday, as i wrote you word.”

“and have you heard from him often?”

“we have heard only once. he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i
particularly begged him to do. he merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention.”

“and my mother--how is she? how are you all?”

“my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. she is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. she does not yet leave her dressing-room. mary and kitty, thank
heaven! are quite well.”

“but you--how are you?” cried elizabeth. “you look pale. how much you
must have gone through!”

her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of
the whole party. jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that jane had no intelligence to give. the sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.

mrs. bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.

“if i had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to brighton
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her. why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after. i always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am. poor, dear
child! and now here’s mr. bennet gone away, and i know he will fight
wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all? the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what
we shall do.”

they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr. gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist mr.
bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.

“do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
it is not quite a week since they left brighton. in a few days more, we
may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done.”

“oh, my dear brother,” replied mrs. bennet, “that is exactly what i
could most wish for. and now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry. and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
after they are married. and, above all things, keep mr. bennet from
fighting. tell him what a dreadful state i am in--that i am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my
heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day. and tell my dear
lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,
for she does not know which are the best warehouses. oh, brother, how
kind you are! i know you will contrive it all.”

but mr. gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.

though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.

in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before. one came from her books, and the other from her toilette. the
faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more
of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty. as for mary, she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--

“this is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”

then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
“unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one
false step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”

elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply. mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to
satisfy. after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
the subject by saying, “but tell me all and everything about it which i
have not already heard. give me further particulars. what did colonel
forster say? had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place? they must have seen them together for ever.”

“colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. i am so
grieved for him. his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. he
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”

“and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry? did he know of
their intending to go off? had colonel forster seen denny himself?”

“yes; but when questioned by _him_, denny denied knowing anything of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ i am
inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”

“and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?”

“how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? i felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in
marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. my father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia’s last letter
she had prepared her for such a step. she had known, it seems, of their
being in love with each other many weeks.”

“but not before they went to brighton?”

“no, i believe not.”

“and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself? does he
know his real character?”

“i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did. he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt:
but i hope this may be false.”

“oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!”

“perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.

“but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what
their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”

“we acted with the best intentions.”

“could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia’s note to his
wife?”

“he brought it with him for us to see.”

jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth. these
were the contents:--

     /* nind “my dear harriet, */

     “you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help
     laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am
     missed. i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with
     who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
     world i love, and he is an angel. i should never be happy without
     him, so think it no harm to be off. you need not send them word at
     longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
     surprise the greater when i write to them, and sign my name lydia
     wickham. what a good joke it will be! i can hardly write for
     laughing. pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my
     engagement, and dancing with him to-night. tell him i hope he will
     excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at
     the next ball we meet with great pleasure. i shall send for my
     clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to
     mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed
     up. good-bye. give my love to colonel forster. i hope you will
     drink to our good journey.

“your affectionate friend,

“lydia bennet.”


“oh, thoughtless, thoughtless lydia!” cried elizabeth when she had
finished it. “what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! but
at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
_scheme_ of infamy. my poor father! how he must have felt it!”

“i never saw anyone so shocked. he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!”

“oh, jane,” cried elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”

“i do not know: i hope there was. but to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. my mother was in hysterics; and though i endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much
as i might have done. but the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties.”

“your attendance upon her has been too much for you. you do not look
well. oh that i had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone.”

“mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.
kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much that her hours of
repose should not be broken in on. my aunt philips came to longbourn on
tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
thursday with me. she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
lucas has been very kind: she walked here on wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us.”

“she had better have stayed at home,” cried elizabeth: “perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one’s neighbours. assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable. let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”

she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

“he meant, i believe,” replied jane, “to go to epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could
be made out from them. his principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham. it had come
with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might be
remarked, he meant to make inquiries at clapham. if he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. i do not know of any
other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this.”

chapter xlviii.


[illustration]

the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
his family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. mr.
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.

mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces. she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet, and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.

all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and
everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister’s ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when, if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.

mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street.
that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr. bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to london, before they procured lodgings. mr. gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. he added, that mr.
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london, and
promised to write again very soon. there was also a postscript to this
effect:--

“i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,
whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. if there
were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such
a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. at present we have
nothing to guide us. colonel forster will, i dare say, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. but, on second thoughts, perhaps
lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any
other person.”

elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.

she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father
and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. it was possible,
however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to
give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting
it, the application was a something to look forward to.

every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. the arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning’s impatience. through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.

but before they heard again from mr. gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from mr. collins; which, as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. it was as
follows:--

     /* “my dear sir, */

     “i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
     from hertfordshire. be assured, my dear sir, that mrs. collins and
     myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable
     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. no
     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
     must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. the
     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of
     this. and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
     suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
     of behaviour in your

     [illustration:

“to whom i have related the affair”

     [_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

     daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,
     at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet,
     i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally
     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an
     age. howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in
     which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins, but likewise by
     lady catherine and her daughter, to whom i have related the affair.
     they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one
     daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for
     who, as lady catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect
     themselves with such a family? and this consideration leads me,
     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain
     event of last november; for had it been otherwise, i must have been
     involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. let me advise you, then,
     my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off
     your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to
     reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.

“i am, dear sir,” etc., etc.

mr. gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up
any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. his
former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them. there was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out
as likely to give any news of him. and in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be
necessary to clear his expenses at brighton. he owed a good deal in the
town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. mr. gardiner
did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family;
jane heard them with horror. “a gamester!” she cried. “this is wholly
unexpected; i had not an idea of it.”

mr. gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was saturday. rendered
spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. when mrs. bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.

“what! is he coming home, and without poor lydia?” she cried. “sure he
will not leave london before he has found them. who is to fight wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?”

as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to london at the same time that mr. bennet
came from it. the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.

mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
pemberley.

the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_,--though elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of
lydia’s infamy somewhat better. it would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.

when mr. bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.

it was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “say
nothing of that. who should suffer but myself? it has been my own doing,
and i ought to feel it.”

“you must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied elizabeth.

“you may well warn me against such an evil. human nature is so prone to
fall into it! no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame. i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
it will pass away soon enough.”

“do you suppose them to be in london?”

“yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”

“and lydia used to want to go to london,” added kitty.

“she is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there
will probably be of some duration.”

then, after a short silence, he continued, “lizzy, i bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which,
considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”

they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s
tea.

“this is a parade,” cried he, “which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! another day i will do the same; i will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
i can,--or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away.”

“i am not going to run away, papa,” said kitty, fretfully. “if _i_
should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia.”

“_you_ go to brighton! i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne,
for fifty pounds! no, kitty, i have at least learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. no officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village. balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. and you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner.”

kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

“well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. if you are a good
girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of
them.”

chapter xlix.


[illustration]

two days after mr. bennet’s return, as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, “i beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask.”

“what do you mean, hill? we have heard nothing from town.”

“dear madam,” cried mrs. hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know
there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner? he has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter.”

away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,--

“if you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the
little copse.”

upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,--

“oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”

“yes, i have had a letter from him by express.”

“well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”

“what is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”

elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. jane now came up.

“read it aloud,” said their father, “for i hardly know myself what it is
about.”

     /* right “gracechurch street, _monday, august 2_. */

“my dear brother,

     “at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
     as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction. soon after
     you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what
     part of london they were. the particulars i reserve till we meet.
     it is enough to know they are discovered: i have seen them
     both----”

     [illustration:

“but perhaps you would like to read it”

     [_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

     “then it is as i always hoped,” cried jane: “they are married!”

     elizabeth read on: “i have seen them both. they are not married,
     nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
     willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on
     your side, i hope it will not be long before they are. all that is
     required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
     equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
     children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
     moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
     life, one hundred pounds per annum. these are conditions which,
     considering everything, i had no hesitation in complying with, as
     far as i thought myself privileged, for you. i shall send this by
     express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. you
     will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr. wickham’s
     circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
     be. the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to
     say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
     discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
     if, as i conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
     in your name throughout the whole of this business, i will
     immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper
     settlement. there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
     to town again; therefore stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on
     my diligence and care. send back your answer as soon as you can,
     and be careful to write explicitly. we have judged it best that my
     niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will
     approve. she comes to us to-day. i shall write again as soon as
     anything more is determined on. yours, etc.

“edw. gardiner.”

“is it possible?” cried elizabeth, when she had finished. “can it be
possible that he will marry her?”

“wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him,” said her
sister. “my dear father, i congratulate you.”

“and have you answered the letter?” said elizabeth.

“no; but it must be done soon.”

most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.

“oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.
consider how important every moment is in such a case.”

“let me write for you,” said jane, “if you dislike the trouble
yourself.”

“i dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”

and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

“and--may i ask?” said elizabeth; “but the terms, i suppose, must be
complied with.”

“complied with! i am only ashamed of his asking so little.”

“and they _must_ marry! yet he is _such_ a man.”

“yes, yes, they must marry. there is nothing else to be done. but there
are two things that i want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how i am ever
to pay him.”

“money! my uncle!” cried jane, “what do you mean, sir?”

“i mean that no man in his proper senses would marry lydia on so slight
a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after i am
gone.”

“that is very true,” said elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me
before. his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! oh,
it must be my uncle’s doings! generous, good man, i am afraid he has
distressed himself. a small sum could not do all this.”

“no,” said her father. “wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds: i should be sorry to think so ill of him,
in the very beginning of our relationship.”

“ten thousand pounds! heaven forbid! how is half such a sum to be
repaid?”

mr. bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

“and they are really to be married!” cried elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. “how strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be
thankful. that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! oh, lydia!”

“i comfort myself with thinking,” replied jane, “that he certainly would
not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. he has children
of his own, and may have more. how could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?”

“if we are ever able to learn what wickham’s debts have been,” said
elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them, because wickham has
not sixpence of his own. the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited. their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. by this time she is
actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! what a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!”

“we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said
jane: “i hope and trust they will yet be happy. his consenting to marry
her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten.”

“their conduct has been such,” replied elizabeth, “as neither you, nor
i, nor anybody, can ever forget. it is useless to talk of it.”

it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. they went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her. he was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly
replied,--

“just as you please.”

“may we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”

“take whatever you like, and get away.”

elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs
together. mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. after a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself. as
soon as jane had read mr. gardiner’s hope of lydia’s being soon married,
her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. to know that her daughter
would be married was enough. she was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.

“my dear, dear lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! she will
be married! i shall see her again! she will be married at sixteen! my
good, kind brother! i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage
everything. how i long to see her! and to see dear wickham too! but the
clothes, the wedding clothes! i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly. lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her. stay, stay, i will go myself. ring the bell,
kitty, for hill. i will put on my things in a moment. my dear, dear
lydia! how merry we shall be together when we meet!”

her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr.
gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.

“for we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great
measure to his kindness. we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist mr. wickham with money.”

“well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him except a few presents. well! i am so happy.
in a short time, i shall have a daughter married. mrs. wickham! how well
it sounds! and she was only sixteen last june. my dear jane, i am in
such a flutter, that i am sure i can’t write; so i will dictate, and you
write for me. we will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”

she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. one day’s delay, she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. other schemes, too, came into her head.

“i will go to meryton,” said she, “as soon as i am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister philips. and as i come back, i can call on
lady lucas and mrs. long. kitty, run down and order the carriage. an
airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure. girls, can i do
anything for you in meryton? oh! here comes hill. my dear hill, have you
heard the good news? miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”

mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy. elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. poor lydia’s
situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she
had need to be thankful. she felt it so; and though, in looking forward,
neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly
expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only
two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.

“the spiteful old ladies”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]




chapter l.


[illustration]

mr. bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. he now wished it more than ever. had he done his duty in that
respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her. the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to
be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.

he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.

when first mr. bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. this son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs.
bennet, for many years after lydia’s birth, had been certain that he
would. this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving. mrs. bennet had no turn for economy; and her
husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.

five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and
the children. but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents. this was one point, with
regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr. bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him. he had never before supposed
that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement. he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mother’s hands, lydia’s expenses had been very little within
that sum.

that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have
as little trouble in the business as possible. when the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. his letter was soon
despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in
its execution. he begged to know further particulars of what he was
indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia to send any
message to her.

the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. it was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. to be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant
farm-house. but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery
was considered certain.

it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

“haye park might do,” said she, “if the gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is
too far off. i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful.”

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “mrs.
bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. i will not encourage the
imprudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn.”

a long dispute followed this declaration; but mr. bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and mrs. bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter. he protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion. mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend
it. that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible. she was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they
took place.

elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.

she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. there were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s
frailty would have mortified her so much. not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there
seemed a gulf impassable between them. had lydia’s marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
mr. darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest
kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.

from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. the
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. she wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
should meet.

what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now
have been gladly and gratefully received! he was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.

she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. his understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.

but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. an union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.

how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she
could not imagine. but how little of permanent happiness could belong to
a couple who were only brought together because their passions were
stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.

mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. to mr. bennet’s
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr. wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.

“it was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his
marriage was fixed on. and i think you will agree with me, in
considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his
account and my niece’s. it is mr. wickham’s intention to go into the
regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are
able and willing to assist him in the army. he has the promise of an
ensigncy in general----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. it is
an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. he
promises fairly; and i hope among different people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. i have
written to colonel forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham
in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which i have
pledged myself. and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin
a list, according to his information? he has given in all his debts; i
hope at least he has not deceived us. haggerston has our directions, and
all will be completed in a week. they will then join his regiment,
unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from mrs.
gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the south. she is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and her mother.--yours, etc.

“e. gardiner.”

mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham’s
removal from the ----shire, as clearly as mr. gardiner could do. but
mrs. bennet was not so well pleased with it. lydia’s being settled in
the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.

“she is so fond of mrs. forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking
to send her away! and there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. the officers may not be so pleasant in general----’s
regiment.”

his daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,
received at first an absolute negative. but jane and elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. and their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the north. when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn. elizabeth
was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme;
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.




[illustration:

“with an affectionate smile”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]




chapter li.


[illustration]

their sister’s wedding-day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. the carriage was sent to meet
them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. their arrival
was dreaded by the elder miss bennets--and jane more especially, who
gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_
been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure.

they came. the family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive
them. smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.

lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.

their reception from mr. bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips. the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.

elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked. lydia was
lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. she turned
from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at
length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of
some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a
great while since she had been there.

wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners
were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. elizabeth
had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat
down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the
impudence of an impudent man. _she_ blushed, and jane blushed; but the
cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of
colour.

there was no want of discourse. the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near
elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies. they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.

“only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since i went away:
it seems but a fortnight, i declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. good gracious! when i went away, i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again! though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was.”

her father lifted up his eyes, jane was distressed, elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--

“oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know i am married to-day? i was
afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle,
so i was determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass
next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the
window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and
smiled like anything.”

elizabeth could bear it no longer. she got up and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour. she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister,--

“ah, jane, i take your place now, and you must go lower, because i am a
married woman.”

it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first. her ease and good
spirits increased. she longed to see mrs. philips, the lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “mrs. wickham” by
each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring
and boast of being married to mrs. hill and the two housemaids.

“well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the
breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? is not he a
charming man? i am sure my sisters must all envy me. i only hope they
may have half my good luck. they must all go to brighton. that is the
place to get husbands. what a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”

“very true; and if i had my will we should. but, my dear lydia, i don’t
at all like your going such a way off. must it be so?”

“oh, lord! yes; there is nothing in that. i shall like it of all things.
you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. we shall be at
newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some balls, and i
will take care to get good partners for them all.”

“i should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.

“and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over.”

“i thank you for my share of the favour,” said elizabeth; “but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands.”

their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. mr. wickham
had received his commission before he left london, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

no one but mrs. bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. these parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think than such as did not.

wickham’s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to lydia’s for him. she had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.

lydia was exceedingly fond of him. he was her dear wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. he did
everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds
on the first of september than anybody else in the country.

one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to elizabeth,--

“lizzy, i never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, i believe. you were
not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it. are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?”

“no, really,” replied elizabeth; “i think there cannot be too little
said on the subject.”

“la! you are so strange! but i must tell you how it went off. we were
married, you know, at st. clement’s, because wickham’s lodgings were in
that parish. and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o’clock. my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.

“well, monday morning came, and i was in such a fuss! i was so afraid,
you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then i should
have gone quite distracted. and there was my aunt, all the time i was
dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a
sermon. however, i did not hear above one word in ten, for i was
thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham. i longed to know whether
he would be married in his blue coat.

“well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: i thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them. if you’ll believe
me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a
fortnight. not one party, or scheme, or anything! to be sure, london was
rather thin, but, however, the little theatre was open.

“well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was
called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone. and then, you
know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. well, i was so
frightened i did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;
and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. but,
luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set
out. however, i recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented
going, the wedding need not be put off, for mr. darcy might have done as
well.”

“mr. darcy!” repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.

“oh, yes! he was to come there with wickham, you know. but, gracious me!
i quite forgot! i ought not to have said a word about it. i promised
them so faithfully! what will wickham say? it was to be such a secret!”

“if it was to be a secret,” said jane, “say not another word on the
subject. you may depend upon my seeking no further.”

“oh, certainly,” said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will
ask you no questions.”

“thank you,” said lydia; “for if you did, i should certainly tell you
all, and then wickham would be so angry.”

on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.

but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information. mr. darcy had been at her
sister’s wedding. it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none. those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. she
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.

“you may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively
speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to
think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance.”

“not that i _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the
letter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out.”

jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of
it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.

elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could. she was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.

     /* right “gracechurch street, _sept. 6_. */

“my dear niece,

     “i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
     morning to answering it, as i foresee that a _little_ writing will
     not comprise what i have to tell you. i must confess myself
     surprised by your application; i did not expect it from _you_.
     don’t think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know,
     that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_
     side. if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
     impertinence. your uncle is as much surprised as i am; and nothing
     but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed
     him to act as he has done. but if you are really innocent and
     ignorant, i must be more explicit. on the very day of my coming
     home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. mr.
     darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. it was all
     over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
     as _yours_ seems to have been. he came to tell mr. gardiner that he
     had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were, and that he
     had seen and talked with them both--wickham repeatedly, lydia once.
     from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day after
     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
     them. the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
     himself that wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as
     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or
     confide in him. he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken
     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to
     lay his private actions open to the world. his character was to
     speak for itself. he called it, therefore, his duty to step
     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on
     by himself. if he _had another_ motive, i am sure it would never
     disgrace him. he had been some days in town before he was able to
     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another
     reason for his resolving to follow us. there is a lady, it seems, a
     mrs. younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was
     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
     he did not say what. she then took a large house in edward street,
     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. this mrs.
     younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he
     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. but
     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
     wanted. she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery
     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
     found. wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in
     london; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
     would have taken up their abode with her. at length, however, our
     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. they were in ----
     street. he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.
     his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
     offering his assistance as far as it would go. but he found lydia
     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. she cared for none
     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of
     leaving wickham. she was sure they should be married some time or
     other, and it did not much signify when. since such were her
     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he
     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. he confessed himself
     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour
     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill
     consequences of lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. he meant to
     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,
     he could conjecture very little about it. he must go somewhere, but
     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live
     on. mr. darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.
     though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have
     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been
     benefited by marriage. but he found, in reply to this question,
     that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making
     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. under such
     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the
     temptation of immediate relief. they met several times, for there
     was much to be discussed. wickham, of course, wanted more than he
     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. everything
     being settled between _them_, mr. darcy’s next step was to make
     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in gracechurch
     street the evening before i came home. but mr. gardiner could not
     be seen; and mr. darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father
     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. he did
     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly
     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him
     till after the departure of the former. he did not leave his name,
     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called
     on business. on saturday he came again. your father was gone, your
     uncle at home, and, as i said before, they had a great deal of talk
     together. they met again on sunday, and then _i_ saw him too. it
     was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express
     was sent off to longbourn. but our visitor was very obstinate. i
     fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,
     after all. he has been accused of many faults at different times;
     but _this_ is the true one. nothing was to be done that he did not
     do himself; though i am sure (and i do not speak it to be thanked,
     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have
     settled the whole. they battled it together for a long time, which
     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it
     deserved. but at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead
     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up
     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely
     against the grain; and i really believe your letter this morning
     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that
     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
     it was due. but, lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or
     jane at most. you know pretty well, i suppose, what has been done
     for the young people. his debts are to be paid, amounting, i
     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another
     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his
     commission purchased. the reason why all this was to be done by him
     alone, was such as i have given above. it was owing to him, to his
     reserve and want of proper consideration, that wickham’s character
     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
     received and noticed as he was. perhaps there was some truth in
     _this_; though i doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_
     reserve can be answerable for the event. but in spite of all this
     fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that
     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
     for _another interest_ in the affair. when all this was resolved
     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
     pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more
     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
     receive the last finish. i believe i have now told you everything.
     it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i
     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. lydia came to
     us, and wickham had constant admission to the house. _he_ was
     exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i
     would not tell you how little i was satisfied with _her_ behaviour
     while she stayed with us, if i had not perceived, by jane’s letter
     last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
     piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you can give you no
     fresh pain. i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all
     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. if she heard me, it
     was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen. i was sometimes
     quite provoked; but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane,
     and for their sakes had patience with her. mr. darcy was punctual
     in his return, and, as lydia imformed you, attended the wedding. he
     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on
     wednesday or thursday. will you be very angry with me, my dear
     lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying (what i was never bold
     enough to say before) how much i like him? his behaviour to us has,
     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.
     his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his
     wife may teach him. i thought him very sly; he hardly ever
     mentioned your name. but slyness seems the fashion. pray forgive
     me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
     far as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i
     have been all round the park. a low phaeton with a nice little pair
     of ponies would be the very thing. but i must write no more. the
     children have been wanting me this half hour.

“yours, very sincerely,

“m. gardiner.”


the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced, of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her
sister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of
goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be
just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest
extent to be true! he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken
on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a
research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he
must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently
meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always
most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to
pronounce. he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard
nor esteem. her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. but it
was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt
that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his
affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to
overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with
wickham. brother-in-law of wickham! every kind of pride must revolt from
the connection. he had, to be sure, done much. she was ashamed to think
how much. but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief. it was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned. it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return. they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, everything to
him. oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she
had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards
him! for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that
in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better
of himself. she read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and
again. it was hardly enough; but it pleased her. she was even sensible
of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly
both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence
subsisted between mr. darcy and herself.

she was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;
and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by
wickham.

“i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,
as he joined her.

“you certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.”

“i should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _we_ were always good friends,
and now we are better.”

“true. are the others coming out?”

“i do not know. mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
meryton. and so, my dear sister, i find, from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen pemberley.”

she replied in the affirmative.

“i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much
for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle. and you saw the
old housekeeper, i suppose? poor reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. but of course she did not mention my name to you.”

“yes, she did.”

“and what did she say?”

“that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well. at such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.”

“certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--

“i was surprised to see darcy in town last month. we passed each other
several times. i wonder what he can be doing there.”

“perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh,” said
elizabeth. “it must be something particular to take him there at this
time of year.”

“undoubtedly. did you see him while you were at lambton? i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had.”

“yes; he introduced us to his sister.”

“and do you like her?”

“very much.”

“i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. when i last saw her, she was not very promising. i am very glad
you liked her. i hope she will turn out well.”

“i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”

“did you go by the village of kympton?”

“i do not recollect that we did.”

“i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had. a most
delightful place! excellent parsonage-house! it would have suited me in
every respect.”

“how should you have liked making sermons?”

“exceedingly well. i should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing. one ought not to repine; but,
to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! the quiet, the
retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of
happiness! but it was not to be. did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance when you were in kent?”

“i _have_ heard from authority, which i thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”

“you have! yes, there was something in _that_; i told you so from the
first, you may remember.”

“i _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly.”

“you did! and it was not wholly without foundation. you may remember
what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”

they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--

“come, mr. wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. do not let us
quarrel about the past. in future, i hope we shall be always of one
mind.”

she held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.

chapter liii.


[illustration]

mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.

the day of his and lydia’s departure soon came; and mrs. bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.

“oh, my dear lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”

“oh, lord! i don’t know. not these two or three years, perhaps.”

“write to me very often, my dear.”

“as often as i can. but you know married women have never much time for
writing. my sisters may write to _me_. they will have nothing else to
do.”

mr. wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. he
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

“he is as fine a fellow,” said mr. bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, “as ever i saw. he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all. i am prodigiously proud of him. i defy even sir william lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”

the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days.

“i often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one’s friends. one seems so forlorn without them.”

“this is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said
elizabeth. “it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single.”

“it is no such thing. lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. if
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”

but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation. the housekeeper
at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
weeks. mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets. she looked at jane, and
smiled, and shook her head, by turns.

“well, well, and so mr. bingley is coming down, sister,” (for mrs.
philips first brought her the news). “well, so much the better. not that
i care about it, though. he is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure i
never want to see him again. but, however, he is very welcome to come to
netherfield, if he likes it. and who knows what _may_ happen? but that
is nothing to us. you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention
a word about it. and so, it is quite certain he is coming?”

“you may depend on it,” replied the other, “for mrs. nichols was in
meryton last night: i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. he
comes down on thursday, at the latest, very likely on wednesday. she was
going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”

miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour. it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--

“i saw you look at me to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and i know i appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from
any silly cause. i was only confused for the moment, because i felt that
i _should_ be looked at. i do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. i am glad of one thing, that he comes
alone; because we shall see the less of him. not that i am afraid of
_myself_, but i dread other people’s remarks.”

elizabeth did not know what to make of it. had she not seen him in
derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.

“yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! i _will_ leave him to himself.”

in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. they were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.

the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

“as soon as ever mr. bingley comes, my dear,” said mrs. bennet, “you
will wait on him, of course.”

“no, no. you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if i
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. but it ended in
nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”

his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
netherfield.

“’tis an _etiquette_ i despise,” said he. “if he wants our society, let
him seek it. he knows where we live. i will not spend _my_ hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again.”

“well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him. but, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, i
am determined. we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon. that will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him.”

consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see mr. bingley, in consequence of it, before
_they_ did. as the day of his arrival drew near,--

“i begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said jane to her sister. “it
would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference; but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. my mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much i suffer from what she
says. happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over!”

“i wish i could say anything to comfort you,” replied elizabeth; “but it
is wholly out of my power. you must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much.”

mr. bingley arrived. mrs. bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. she counted the days
that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of
seeing him before. but on the third morning after his arrival in
hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the
paddock, and ride towards the house.

her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked--she saw mr. darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.

“there is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said kitty; “who can it be?”

“some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not
know.”

“la!” replied kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”

“good gracious! mr. darcy!--and so it does, i vow. well, any friend of
mr. bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else i must
say that i hate the very sight of him.”

jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern. she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on of her dislike of mr. darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as mr. bingley’s friend, without being heard by either
of them. but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be
suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs.
gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards
him. to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what jane felt for bingley. her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in derbyshire.

the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.

“let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early
enough for expectation.”

she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister as the servant was approaching the door. jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected. on the
gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.

elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. she
had ventured only one glance at darcy. he looked serious as usual; and,
she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at pemberley. but, perhaps, he could not in her
mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. it was a
painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.

bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. he was received by mrs.
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her courtesy and address of his friend.

elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.

darcy, after inquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did--a question
which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. he
was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
it had not been so in derbyshire. there he had talked to her friends
when he could not to herself. but now several minutes elapsed, without
bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
found him looking at jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
the ground. more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. she was disappointed, and angry
with herself for being so.

“could i expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “yet why did he come?”

she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.

she inquired after his sister, but could do no more.

“it is a long time, mr. bingley, since you went away,” said mrs. bennet.

he readily agreed to it.

“i began to be afraid you would never come back again. people _did_ say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope
it is not true. a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
since you went away. miss lucas is married and settled: and one of my
own daughters. i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. it was in the ‘times’ and the ‘courier,’ i know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be. it was only said, ‘lately,
george wickham, esq., to miss lydia bennet,’ without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
it was my brother gardiner’s drawing up, too, and i wonder how he came
to make such an awkward business of it. did you see it?”

bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. how mr. darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.

“it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”
continued her mother; “but at the same time, mr. bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken away from me. they are gone down to newcastle, a
place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, i do not
know how long. his regiment is there; for i suppose you have heard of
his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.
thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he
deserves.”

elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy, was in such misery
of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. it drew from her, however,
the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done
before; and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the
country at present. a few weeks, he believed.

“when you have killed all your own birds, mr. bingley,” said her mother,
“i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr.
bennet’s manor. i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the coveys for you.”

elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. at that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.

“the first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be
in company with either of them. their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! let me never see either
one or the other again!”

yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former
lover. when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every
five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. he found her
as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty. jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.

when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs. bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
longbourn in a few days’ time.

“you are quite a visit in my debt, mr. bingley,” she added; “for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us as soon as you returned. i have not forgot, you see; and i assure you
i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your
engagement.”

bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business. they then went away.

mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.

as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects
which must deaden them more. mr. darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed
her.

“why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,
“did he come at all?”

she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

“he could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he
was in town; and why not to me? if he fears me, why come hither? if he
no longer cares for me, why silent? teasing, teasing man! i will think
no more about him.”

her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth.

“now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly
easy. i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. i am glad he dines here on tuesday. it will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance.”

“yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said elizabeth, laughingly. “oh, jane!
take care.”

“my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”

“i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever.”

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs. bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the
good-humour and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour’s visit,
had revived.

on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time. when they repaired to the
dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself. on entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. he placed himself by her.

elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. he
bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards mr. darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.

his behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, jane’s happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour. mr. darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them. he was on one side of her mother. she knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. her mother’s ungraciousness
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth’s mind;
and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.

she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,
than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen
came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her
chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

“if he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “i shall give him up for
ever.”

the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair. and on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--

“the men shan’t come and part us, i am determined. we want none of them;
do we?”

darcy had walked away to another part of the room. she followed him with
her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!

“a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”

she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--

“is your sister at pemberley still?”

“yes; she will remain there till christmas.”

“and quite alone? have all her friends left her?”

“mrs. annesley is with her. the others have been gone on to scarborough
these three weeks.”

she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. he stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering
to elizabeth again, he walked away.

when the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose; and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. she now lost every expectation of pleasure.
they were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

“well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what
say you to the day? i think everything has passed off uncommonly well, i
assure you. the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw. the
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch. the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucases’ last week; and even mr. darcy acknowledged that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least. and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater
beauty. mrs. long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not. and
what do you think she said besides? ‘ah! mrs. bennet, we shall have her
at netherfield at last!’ she did, indeed. i do think mrs. long is as
good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved
girls, and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously.”

[illustration:

     “m^{rs}. long and her nieces.”

mrs. bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of
bingley’s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

“it has been a very agreeable day,” said miss bennet to elizabeth. “the
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. i hope we
may often meet again.”

elizabeth smiled.

“lizzy, you must not do so. you must not suspect me. it mortifies me. i
assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. i am
perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
any design of engaging my affection. it is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man.”

“you are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment.”

“how hard it is in some cases to be believed! and how impossible in
others! but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge?”

“that is a question which i hardly know how to answer. we all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your
confidante.”

chapter lv.


[illustration]

a few days after this visit, mr. bingley called again, and alone. his
friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in
ten days’ time. he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

“next time you call,” said she, “i hope we shall be more lucky.”

he should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she
would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on
them.

“can you come to-morrow?”

yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.

he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed. in ran mrs. bennet to her daughters’ room, in her
dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--

“my dear jane, make haste and hurry down. he is come--mr. bingley is
come. he is, indeed. make haste, make haste. here, sarah, come to miss
bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. never mind miss
lizzy’s hair.”

“we will be down as soon as we can,” said jane; “but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”

“oh! hang kitty! what has she to do with it? come, be quick, be quick!
where is your sash, my dear?”

but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.

the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. after tea, mr. bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and mary went upstairs to her instrument. two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
kitty did, she very innocently said, “what is the matter, mamma? what do
you keep winking at me for? what am i to do?”

“nothing, child, nothing. i did not wink at you.” she then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to kitty,--

“come here, my love, i want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such
premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. in a
few minutes, mrs. bennet half opened the door and called out,--

“lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you.”

elizabeth was forced to go.

“we may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall. “kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room.”

elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.

mrs. bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. bingley was
everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her
daughter. his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable
addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged
officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a
forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the
daughter.

he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away
an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs. bennet’s
means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.

after this day, jane said no more of her indifference. not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in the
happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr. darcy
returned within the stated time. seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s
concurrence.

bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr. bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on. the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him. bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening mrs. bennet’s invention was again at work to get
everybody away from him and her daughter. elizabeth, who had a letter to
write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for
as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.

but on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,
she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her
mother had been too ingenious for her. on opening the door, she
perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as
if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,
the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each
other, would have told it all. _their_ situation was awkward enough; but
_hers_ she thought was still worse. not a syllable was uttered by
either; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when
bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,
whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.

jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.

“’tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. i do not deserve it. oh,
why is not everybody as happy?”

elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express. every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane. but she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.

“i must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself. he is gone to my father already. oh, lizzy, to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall i bear so much happiness?”

she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card-party, and was sitting upstairs with kitty.

elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.

“and this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious
circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”

in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.

“where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.

“with my mother upstairs. she will be down in a moment, i dare say.”

he then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister. elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship. they shook hands with
great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of jane’s perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of
jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.

it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
miss bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon. mrs. bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
mr. bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was.

not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,--

“jane, i congratulate you. you will be a very happy woman.”

jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.

“you are a good girl,” he replied, “and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. your tempers are by no means unlike. you are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income.”

“i hope not so. imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in _me_.”

“exceed their income! my dear mr. bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you
talking of? why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more.” then addressing her daughter, “oh, my dear, dear jane, i am so
happy! i am sure i shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. i knew how it
would be. i always said it must be so, at last. i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when
he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was
that you should come together. oh, he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!”

wickham, lydia, were all forgotten. jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. at that moment she cared for no other. her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.

mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.

elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but
she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of
separation that must sometimes occur. in the absence of jane, he always
attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and
when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief.

“he has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! i had not believed
it possible.”

“i suspected as much,” replied elizabeth. “but how did he account for
it?”

“it must have been his sisters’ doing. they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. but when they see,
as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we
can never be what we once were to each other.”

“that is the most unforgiving speech,” said elizabeth, “that i ever
heard you utter. good girl! it would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of miss bingley’s pretended regard.”

“would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november he
really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent
would have prevented his coming down again?”

“he made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty.”

this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.

elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend; for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.

“i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried
jane. “oh, lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all? if i could but see you as happy! if there were but such
another man for you!”

“if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you.
till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your
happiness. no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very
good luck, i may meet with another mr. collins in time.”

the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret. mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. philips, and
she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in meryton.

the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world; though only a few weeks before, when lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.

chapter lvi.


[illustration]

one morning, about a week after bingley’s engagement with jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn. it was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. the horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. as it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. they both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered. it was lady catherine de bourgh.

they were of course all intending to be surprised: but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs.
bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what elizabeth felt.

she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyship’s entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.

mrs. bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. after sitting
for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to elizabeth,--

“i hope you are well, miss bennet. that lady, i suppose, is your
mother?”

elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

“and _that_, i suppose, is one of your sisters?”

“yes, madam,” said mrs. bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine.
“she is my youngest girl but one. my youngest of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,
who, i believe, will soon become a part of the family.”

“you have a very small park here,” returned lady catherine, after a
short silence.

“it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but, i
assure you, it is much larger than sir william lucas’s.”

“this must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in
summer: the windows are full west.”

mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,--

“may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and
mrs. collins well?”

“yes, very well. i saw them the night before last.”

elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. but no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

mrs. bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment: but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to elizabeth,--

“miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. i should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company.”

“go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the
different walks. i think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”

elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. as they passed through the hall,
lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be
decent-looking rooms, walked on.

her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.

“after a short survey”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]

“how could i ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in
her face.

as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following
manner:--

“you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
come.”

elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

“indeed, you are mistaken, madam; i have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.”

“miss bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to
know that i am not to be trifled with. but however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such
moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it. a report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. i was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
_you_--that miss elizabeth bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, mr. darcy. though i
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though i would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to
you.”

“if you believed it impossible to be true,” said elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, “i wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. what could your ladyship propose by it?”

“at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”

“your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family,” said elizabeth
coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.”

“if! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?”

“i never heard that it was.”

“and can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”

“i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. _you_
may ask questions which _i_ shall not choose to answer.”

“this is not to be borne. miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied. has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”

“your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”

“it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. but _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. you
may have drawn him in.”

“if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it.”

“miss bennet, do you know who i am? i have not been accustomed to such
language as this. i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”

“but you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as
this ever induce me to be explicit.”

“let me be rightly understood. this match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. no, never. mr. darcy is
engaged to _my daughter_. now, what have you to say?”

“only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me.”

lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--

“the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. from their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. it was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of hers. while in their cradles we planned the
union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be
accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family? do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh? are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”

“yes; and i had heard it before. but what is that to me? if there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
miss de bourgh. you both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. its completion depended on others. if mr. darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?”

“because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. yes, miss
bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. you will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.”

“these are heavy misfortunes,” replied elizabeth. “but the wife of mr.
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.”

“obstinate, headstrong girl! i am ashamed of you! is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? is nothing due to me on that
score? let us sit down. you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i
be dissuaded from it. i have not been used to submit to any person’s
whims. i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”

“_that_ will make your ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on _me_.”

“i will not be interrupted! hear me in silence. my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. they are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. their fortune on
both sides is splendid. they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide
them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,
connections, or fortune! is this to be endured? but it must not, shall
not be! if you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to
quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.”

“in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are
equal.”

“true. you _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. but what was your mother? who
are your uncles and aunts? do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition.”

“whatever my connections may be,” said elizabeth, “if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”

“tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?”

though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment’s deliberation,--

“i am not.”

lady catherine seemed pleased.

“and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?”

“i will make no promise of the kind.”

“miss bennet, i am shocked and astonished. i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i
will ever recede. i shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance i require.”

“and i certainly _never_ shall give it. i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make
_their_ marriage at all more probable? supposing him to be attached to
me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on
his cousin? allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged. you have widely mistaken my
character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,
i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine. i must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the
subject.”

“not so hasty, if you please. i have by no means done. to all the
objections i have already urged i have still another to add. i am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous
elopement. i know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a
patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. and is
_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? is _her_ husband, who is the son
of his late father’s steward, to be his brother? heaven and earth!--of
what are you thinking? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?”

“you can _now_ have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.
“you have insulted me, in every possible method. i must beg to return to
the house.”

and she rose as she spoke. lady catherine rose also, and they turned
back. her ladyship was highly incensed.

“you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
unfeeling, selfish girl! do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”

“lady catherine, i have nothing further to say. you know my sentiments.”

“you are then resolved to have him?”

“i have said no such thing. i am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”

“it is well. you refuse, then, to oblige me. you refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. you are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”

“neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied elizabeth, “has any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. no principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy. and with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn.”

“and this is your real opinion! this is your final resolve! very well. i
shall now know how to act. do not imagine, miss bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. i came to try you. i hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point.”

in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--

“i take no leave of you, miss bennet. i send no compliments to your
mother. you deserve no such attention. i am most seriously displeased.”

elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. her mother
impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

“she did not choose it,” said her daughter; “she would go.”

“she is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.
she is on her road somewhere, i dare say; and so, passing through
meryton, thought she might as well call on you. i suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?”

elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.

chapter lvii.


[illustration]

the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. lady catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr.
darcy. it was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. and her neighbours at
lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the
collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady catherine,) had
only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had
looked forward to as possible at some future time.

in revolving lady catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent the marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an
application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared
not pronounce. she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. with his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him. in that case he would return no more. lady
catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.

“if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days,” she added, “i shall know how to understand
it. i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him
at all.”

the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased mrs. bennet’s curiosity; and
elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.

the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

“lizzy,” said he, “i was going to look for you: come into my room.”

she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. it suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.

she followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. he
then said,--

“i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. i did not know before that i had _two_ daughters on the brink
of matrimony. let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”

the colour now rushed into elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself, when her father continued,--

“you look conscious. young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but i think i may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the
name of your admirer. this letter is from mr. collins.”

“from mr. collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”

“something very much to the purpose, of course. he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
lucases. i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says
on that point. what relates to yourself is as follows:--‘having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. your daughter
elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after
her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate
may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages
in this land.’ can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?
‘this young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the
heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and
extensive patronage. yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn
my cousin elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a
precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,
you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ have you any idea,
lizzy, who this gentleman is? but now it comes out. ‘my motive for
cautioning you is as follows:--we have reason to imagine that his aunt,
lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly
eye.’ _mr. darcy_, you see, is the man! now, lizzy, i think i _have_
surprised you. could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related? mr. darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in
his life! it is admirable!”

elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.

“are you not diverted?”

“oh, yes. pray read on.”

“‘after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of
some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give
her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. i thought it my
duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she
and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ mr.
collins, moreover, adds, ‘i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia’s sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. it was an
encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should
very strenuously have opposed it. you ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _that_ is his notion of
christian forgiveness! the rest of his letter is only about his dear
charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. but,
lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. you are not going to be
_missish_, i hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. for
what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them
in our turn?”

“oh,” cried elizabeth, “i am exceedingly diverted. but it is so
strange!”

“yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_
pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! much as i abominate
writing, i would not give up mr. collins’s correspondence for any
consideration. nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine
about this report? did she call to refuse her consent?”

to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it. elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. it was necessary to laugh when she
would rather have cried. her father had most cruelly mortified her by
what he said of mr. darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of
his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.

chapter lviii.


[illustration]

instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine’s
visit. the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs. bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed
their all walking out. it was agreed to. mrs. bennet was not in the
habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together. bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them. they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy
were to entertain each other. very little was said by either; kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.

they walked towards the lucases’, because kitty wished to call upon
maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was
high, she immediately said,--

“mr. darcy, i am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours. i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister. ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it. were it known to the rest
of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”

“i am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. i did not think mrs. gardiner
was so little to be trusted.”

“you must not blame my aunt. lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could
not rest till i knew the particulars. let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them.”

“if you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny. but your
_family_ owe me nothing. much as i respect them, i believe i thought
only of _you_.”

elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. after a short pause,
her companion added, “you are too generous to trifle with me. if your
feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once. _my_
affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever.”

elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. the
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but
though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings
which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection
every moment more valuable.

they walked on without knowing in what direction. there was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through
london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship’s apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. but, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

“it taught me to hope,” said he, “as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly.”

elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “yes, you know enough of
my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. after abusing you so
abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations.”

“what did you say of me that i did not deserve? for though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. it was
unpardonable. i cannot think of it without abhorrence.”

“we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening,” said elizabeth. “the conduct of neither, if strictly
examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, i hope,
improved in civility.”

“i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. the recollection of what i
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. your
reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.’ those were your words. you know not, you can
scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, i
confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”

“i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way.”

“i can easily believe it. you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, i am sure you did. the turn of your countenance i shall never
forget, as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me.”

“oh, do not repeat what i then said. these recollections will not do at
all. i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”

darcy mentioned his letter. “did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you
think better of me? did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?”

she explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all
her former prejudices had been removed.

“i knew,” said he, “that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. i hope you have destroyed the letter. there was one part,
especially the opening of it, which i should dread your having the power
of reading again. i can remember some expressions which might justly
make you hate me.”

“the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies.”

“when i wrote that letter,” replied darcy, “i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool; but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit.”

“the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. the
adieu is charity itself. but think no more of the letter. the feelings
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely
different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance
attending it ought to be forgotten. you must learn some of my
philosophy. think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.”

“i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
ignorance. but with _me_, it is not so. painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. i have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. as a
child i was taught what was _right_, but i was not taught to correct my
temper. i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit. unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),
i was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own. such i was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such i might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth! what do i not
owe you! you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous. by you, i was properly humbled. i came to you without a
doubt of my reception. you showed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”

“had you then persuaded yourself that i should?”

“indeed i had. what will you think of my vanity? i believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.”

“my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, i assure
you. i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. how you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”

“hate you! i was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to
take a proper direction.”

“i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at
pemberley. you blamed me for coming?”

“no, indeed, i felt nothing but surprise.”

“your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i
confess that i did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”

“my object _then_,” replied darcy, “was to show you, by every civility
in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves, i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half
an hour after i had seen you.”

he then told her of georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there
had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.

she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each to be dwelt on farther.

after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.

“what could have become of mr. bingley and jane?” was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.

“i must ask whether you were surprised?” said elizabeth.

“not at all. when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen.”

“that is to say, you had given your permission. i guessed as much.” and
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.

“on the evening before my going to london,” said he, “i made a
confession to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago. i told
him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. his surprise was great. he had never had
the slightest suspicion. i told him, moreover, that i believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together.”

elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.

“did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”

“from the former. i had narrowly observed her, during the two visits
which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection.”

“and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.”

“it did. bingley is most unaffectedly modest. his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made everything easy. i was obliged to confess one
thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him. he was
angry. but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. he has heartily forgiven me
now.”

elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and
it was rather too early to begin. in anticipating the happiness of
bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. in the hall they
parted.

chapter lix.


[illustration]

“my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table. she had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
knowledge. she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

the evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. she anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one
liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.

at night she opened her heart to jane. though suspicion was very far
from miss bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.

“you are joking, lizzy. this cannot be! engaged to mr. darcy! no, no,
you shall not deceive me: i know it to be impossible.”

“this is a wretched beginning, indeed! my sole dependence was on you;
and i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. yet, indeed, i
am in earnest. i speak nothing but the truth. he still loves me, and we
are engaged.”

jane looked at her doubtingly. “oh, lizzy! it cannot be. i know how much
you dislike him.”

“you know nothing of the matter. _that_ is all to be forgot. perhaps i
did not always love him so well as i do now; but in such cases as these
a good memory is unpardonable. this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself.”

miss bennet still looked all amazement. elizabeth again, and more
seriously, assured her of its truth.

“good heaven! can it be really so? yet now i must believe you,” cried
jane. “my dear, dear lizzy, i would, i do congratulate you; but are you
certain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?”

“there can be no doubt of that. it is settled between us already that we
are to be the happiest couple in the world. but are you pleased, jane?
shall you like to have such a brother?”

“very, very much. nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight. but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. and do you
really love him quite well enough? oh, lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?”

“oh, yes! you will only think i feel _more_ than i ought to do when i
tell you all.”

“what do you mean?”

“why, i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley. i am
afraid you will be angry.”

“my dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. i want to talk very seriously.
let me know everything that i am to know without delay. will you tell me
how long you have loved him?”

“it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began;
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at pemberley.”

another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment. when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing
further to wish.

“now i am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. i
always had a value for him. were it for nothing but his love of you, i
must always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley’s friend and your
husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me. but,
lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton! i owe all that i know
of it to another, not to you.”

elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. she had been unwilling to
mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in lydia’s marriage. all was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.

“good gracious!” cried mrs. bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, “if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? i had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. what shall we do with him?
lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley’s
way.”

elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.

as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, “mrs. bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”

“i advise mr. darcy, and lizzy, and kitty,” said mrs. bennet, “to walk
to oakham mount this morning. it is a nice long walk, and mr. darcy has
never seen the view.”

“it may do very well for the others,” replied mr. bingley; “but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty. won’t it, kitty?”

kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently
consented. as she went upstairs to get ready, mrs. bennet followed her,
saying,--

“i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself; but i hope you will not mind it. it is
all for jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”

during their walk, it was resolved that mr. bennet’s consent should be
asked in the course of the evening: elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother’s. she could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.

in the evening, soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
mr. darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. she did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “go to your father; he
wants you in the library.” she was gone directly.

her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
“lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? are you out of your senses to be
accepting this man? have not you always hated him?”

how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to mr. darcy.

“or, in other words, you are determined to have him. he is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.
but will they make you happy?”

“have you any other objection,” said elizabeth, “than your belief of my
indifference?”

“none at all. we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him.”

“i do, i do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “i love him.
indeed he has no improper pride. he is perfectly amiable. you do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms.”

“lizzy,” said her father, “i have given him my consent. he is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. i now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him. but let me advise you to think better of it. i know your
disposition, lizzy. i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked
up to him as a superior. your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. my child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. you know not what you are
about.”

elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and, at length, by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,
she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the
match.

“well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “i have no more to
say. if this be the case, he deserves you. i could not have parted with
you, my lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”

to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr. darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia. he heard her with astonishment.

“this is an evening of wonders, indeed! and so, darcy did everything;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him
his commission! so much the better. it will save me a world of trouble
and economy. had it been your uncle’s doing, i must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own
way. i shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”

he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading
mr. collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “if any young men come
for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure.”

elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. everything was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. its effect was most extraordinary;
for, on first hearing it, mrs. bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could
comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what
was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. she began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

“good gracious! lord bless me! only think! dear me! mr. darcy! who would
have thought it? and is it really true? oh, my sweetest lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. i am so
pleased--so happy. such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! oh, my
dear lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. i
hope he will overlook it. dear, dear lizzy. a house in town! everything
that is charming! three daughters married! ten thousand a year! oh,
lord! what will become of me? i shall go distracted.”

this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and
elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. but before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.

“my dearest child,” she cried, “i can think of nothing else. ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! ’tis as good as a lord! and a
special licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.
but, my dearest love, tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond
of, that i may have it to-morrow.”

this was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’
consent, there was still something to be wished for. but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for mrs. bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.

elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.

“i admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but i think i shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as jane’s.”

“the obsequious civility.”

[_copyright 1894 by george allen._]]




chapter lx.


[illustration]

elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr.
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “how could
you begin?” said she. “i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?”

“i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. it is too long ago. i was in the middle before i
knew that i _had_ begun.”

“my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. now, be
sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”

“for the liveliness of your mind i did.”

“you may as well call it impertinence at once. it was very little less.
the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. i roused and
interested you, because i was so unlike _them_. had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. to be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love.”

“was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was
ill at netherfield?”

“dearest jane! who could have done less for her? but make a virtue of it
by all means. my good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and i shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last? what made you so shy of me, when you
first called, and afterwards dined here? why, especially, when you
called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”

“because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”

“but i was embarrassed.”

“and so was i.”

“you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”

“a man who had felt less might.”

“how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it! but i wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. i wonder when
you _would_ have spoken if i had not asked you! my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect. _too
much_, i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the
subject? this will never do.”

“you need not distress yourself. the moral will be perfectly fair. lady
catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. i was not in a humour to
wait for an opening of yours. my aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,
and i was determined at once to know everything.”

“lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. but tell me, what did you come down to
netherfield for? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequences?”

“my real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if i could, whether i
might ever hope to make you love me. my avowed one, or what i avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to bingley, and
if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made.”

“shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to
befall her?”

“i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth. but it ought to
be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done
directly.”

“and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. but
i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”

from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy
had been overrated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner’s
long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:--

“i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the
truth, i was too cross to write. you supposed more than really existed.
but _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,
indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly
err. you must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more
than you did in your last. i thank you again and again, for not going to
the lakes. how could i be so silly as to wish it! your idea of the
ponies is delightful. we will go round the park every day. i am the
happiest creature in the world. perhaps other people have said so
before, but no one with such justice. i am happier even than jane; she
only smiles, i laugh. mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that
can be spared from me. you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.
yours,” etc.

mr. darcy’s letter to lady catherine was in a different style, and still
different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins, in return
for his last.

     /* “dear sir, */

     “i must trouble you once more for congratulations. elizabeth will
     soon be the wife of mr. darcy. console lady catherine as well as
     you can. but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew. he has
     more to give.

“yours sincerely,” etc.

miss bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching
marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. she wrote even to
jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former
professions of regard. jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and
though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much
kinder answer than she knew was deserved.

the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was
as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.

before any answer could arrive from mr. collins, or any congratulations
to elizabeth from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge. the reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident. lady catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that
charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. at such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband. he bore it, however, with admirable calmness. he could even
listen to sir william lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st. james’s, with very decent composure. if he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.

mrs. philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though mrs. philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley’s
good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be
vulgar. nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at
all likely to make her more elegant. elizabeth did all she could to
shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to
keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might
converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings
arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its
pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward
with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so
little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their
family party at pemberley.

chapter lxi.

happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. with what delighted pride she
afterwards visited mrs. bingley, and talked of mrs. darcy, may be
guessed. i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of
her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,
it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic
felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous
and invariably silly.

mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. he delighted in
going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth. so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. the darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to derbyshire; and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters. in society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great. she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia; and, removed from the influence of lydia’s example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. from the further disadvantage of lydia’s
society she was of course carefully kept; and though mrs. wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet’s being quite
unable to sit alone. mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.

as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of
everything, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be
prevailed on to make his fortune. the congratulatory letter which
elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by
his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. the
letter was to this effect:--

     /* “my dear lizzy, */

     “i wish you joy. if you love mr. darcy half so well as i do my dear
     wickham, you must be very happy. it is a great comfort to have you
     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will
     think of us. i am sure wickham would like a place at court very
     much; and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
     upon without some help. any place would do of about three or four
     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to mr. darcy about it,
     if you had rather not.

“yours,” etc.

as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she
frequently sent them. it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards
discharging their bills. their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. they were always moving from place to place in quest of a
cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. his affection
for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,
in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her. though darcy could never
receive _him_ at pemberley, yet, for elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him
further in his profession. lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when
her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath; and with the
bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even
bingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_
of giving them a hint to be gone.

miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy’s marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she
dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to elizabeth.

pemberley was now georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see. they were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended. georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of
talking to her brother. he, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way. by elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. but at length, by elizabeth’s persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. darcy,
as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

section 2. information about the mission of project gutenberg™

project gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. it
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching project gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the project gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. in 2001, the project
gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for project gutenberg™ and future
generations. to learn more about the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
sections 3 and 4 and the foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

section 4. information about donations to the project gutenberg

project gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the irs.

the foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the united
states. compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. we do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. to send
donations or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

while we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

international donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the united states. u.s. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. to

section 5. general information about project gutenberg™ electronic works

professor michael s. hart was the originator of the project
gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. for forty years, he produced and
distributed project gutenberg™ ebooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

project gutenberg™ ebooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the u.s. unless a copyright notice is included. thus, we do not
necessarily keep ebooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

most people start at our website which has the main pg search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

this website includes information about project gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the project gutenberg literary
archive foundation, how to help produce our new ebooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new ebooks.
